  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Chapter1WhoGoesThere_Title">Chapter 1: Who Goes There?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Chapter1WhoGoesThere_Description">Deep in the heart of the temple complex, an advance scout party from your army discover the archaeologist. That's what they call him on account of the tools and instruments they found in his possession, as he lay wounded, breathing hard, on the stone ground. He says he is a Vaulter by the name of Llic Zoltan, claims wild animals attacked him while exploring.
 
Whether you believe him or not, he recounts an incredible tale about his distant ancestors hailing from the stars, about how a great Vaulter vessel crashed onto the world centuries ago. Unlike his kin he is convinced other starfaring vessels still exist on Auriga -- and says that by finding the the traces of their explosive departures, he can find the vessels themselves...
 
He says he is willing to share the fruits of his labor if you will help with his next expedition. He believes he is close, but the expedition will not be easy and needs many provisions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Chapter1WhoGoesThere_Objective">A stranger, Llic Zoltan, believes starfaring vessels still exist on Auriga and wants to track the scars left by their departures. Prepare for an expedition by assembling necessary provisions.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Chapter2TheToolForTheJob_Title">Chapter 2: Under a Starlight Sky</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Chapter2TheToolForTheJob_Description">Llic's enthusiasm for the forthcoming expedition is infectious. Even if he's pursuing a fantasy, you can't doubt his sincerity, nor his energy. Among the soldiers chosen to accompany the Vaulter you can feel an excitement, a feeling that they have a real purpose, one that might change everything.
 
Although you shouldn't, sometimes you indulge the dream too. Llic has weaved magical words about the stars, how each point of light among the millions in the silky black night sky is a chance of a fertile world where your people could be truly free.
 
Llic has identified two sites of Endless ruins that show the effects of the great forces that would have been required to lift a ship into the sky. He is convinced that vindication is near...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Chapter2TheToolForTheJob_Objective">The Vaulter Llic is convinced he is close to discovering an ancient Endless launchpad. Mount the necessary expeditions under appropriate leadership.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Chapter2TheToolForTheJob_Step1Tooltip">Make sure that the exploring Army is led by a Hero!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Chapter2TheToolForTheJob_Outcome">The digs unearthed copious valuable materials, a large cache of Endless writings, but of a vessel capable of traveling the stars there is no sign. Llic is furious.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Chapter3OriginOfTheEvil_Title">Chapter 3: A Man Possessed</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Chapter3OriginOfTheEvil_Description">For such an academic, learned man, you'd never have guessed that Llic could work himself up into such a rage. That first night, when the expedition had explored every last antechamber in the scorched Endless ruins, when the soldiers sat exhausted from all the debris they'd cleared, when not an inkling of a so-called 'starship' materialized, Llic's animal cries of frustration echoed through the entire ruins.
 
The next day his serenity returned. And his fire. A setback, he called the expeditions, nothing more. With the new Endless writings uncovered, together with his old research, he was certain new leads would be discovered. The Endless were spacefaring gods, he says. The destruction throughout this ruin could only have been from successive launches of giant vessels.
 
He calls for your renewed aid, pleads that as you have come this far with him, you must not abandon him now. He will need researchers, linguists, workshops, and more besides, but the prize will be great.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Chapter3OriginOfTheEvil_Objective">Llic believes the new Endless writings still hold the key to locating a launch site and a star vessel. Provide him with the necessary scientific support.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Chapter3OriginOfTheEvil_Outcome">Eureka! The intense research of the Endless writings has led to the reconstruction of an ancient device: a transmitting 'key' that has opened a secret bunker in the earlier ruinsâ€¦</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Chapter4OldVoices_Title">Chapter 4: Old Haunts</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Chapter4OldVoices_Description">After so many years of searching, Llic cannot contain his excitement. Nobody, he believes, has ever resurrected Endless technology before, even if that technology is, essentially, nothing more complex than a simple key to a door. But what lies behind that door is most intriguing...
 
The Vaulter is sure all his prayers will be answered in that deep crypt, but other voices counsel that the archeologist is making a leap of faith, that he is seeing order where there is only chaos. Others suggest that the secret bunker may indeed hold remains of the Endless, but not anything as grand as a starship.
 
Your advisors also caution that it is not infeasible that ancient defensive forces may be triggered by any approach. Bringing a strong military force would be prudent.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Chapter4OldVoices_Objective">The Vaulter's tireless work has born... What? Nobody knows yet. It is time to explore the secret Endless bunker -- with a sufficiently powerful army should its defense mechanisms still be functional.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Chapter4OldVoices_Step2Tooltip">At least one of your Armies must stay within 3 tiles distance from the Ruin</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Chapter4OldVoices_Outcome">Llic is stunned to tears. These ruins were damaged not by ships departing, but by weapons fired from somewhere else in the cosmos. Llic demands a moment alone, and steps out of the bunker. He is never seen again. The mysterious questions he unearthed remain, however. Who would shoot at a planet, not simply destroy it, and why?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_LegendsOfOld_Title">Legends Of Old</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_LegendsOfOld_Description">Archeological pieces deciphered by some of the empire's foremost authorities on the Endless have revealed something most intriguing -- and tempting. They suggest that the impenetrable security systems guarding a rare Endless artifact at an Aurigan ruins will soon be disabled for a fixed period of time. That's the good news. The bad news is that the evidence is ambiguous as regards to the exact location of the ruins, with two sites being prime candidates. Worse, the wrong site is most likely to trigger aggressive defense forces if explored...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_LegendsOfOld_Objective">One of two possible ruins holds a lot of dust and a talisman of immense power. The other only enemies. Find the artifact.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Infestation_Title">Cooperative: Infestation!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Infestation_Description">The Urkans -- Kazar, Chaka, and Fakir -- have risen from the depths of the earth, making the ground quake with their every stride, and striking fear into the hearts of every Aurigan. Their minions, the aggressive lice that emerged with them, are terrorizing ordinary folk, and threaten to run rampage over the entire land. All empires have agreed this infestation needs a collective response, and have committed to eliminating as many of the lice as they can. As a reward to encourage participation in the hunt, the empires have agreed that the empire with the best number of kills will enjoy a handsome bounty.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Infestation_Objective">Peace across all lands is threatened! The Urkan's despised lice must be eradicated without prejudice.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Volcanoformers_Description">What dark sorcery is this? On the far horizon, a black peak riven with fire spews an ashen rain across the surrounding terrain, threatening to permenantly turn good land into blackened wasteland. Reports have it that these artificial monstrosities are scattered across the whole of Auriga, always springing up in empty places, far from major cities.
 
Who seeded such destructive mechanisms? To what end? These are vital questions, but not our focus at this time. Now, we must marshal our power -- collectively, as Aurigans united! -- to destroy as many of these wicked machines before our lands are scorched beyond hope.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_Volcanoformers_Objective">Auriga's pristine lands must be protected! Destroy the barbaric terraforming machinery before the world becomes a volcanic hellscape.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_WinterCelebrations_Description">Aurigan winters are feared for their length and intensity. Much of an empire's effort during the other seasons must go into planning for winter's arrival or mitigating its effects.
 
This time, why not try something different? Consider making winter a time of festivities, a time when families and communities come together, a time when shared values and experiences are celebrated. Enough of these dark moods that mirror the dark skies!

A courier has arrived with a message from a distant land, reporting that a mysterious figure has been trapped in some sort of disaster at one of the Endless's ruins. Furthermore, the being in question appears to be one of the Dust-wielding Heroes, given that they had been moving large masses of rock in an attempt to work their way out.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_WeTakeFromTheLand_Description">It seems that a group of "freelance entrepreneurs" (Note: pirates and brigands) wants to come clean. However, they need a justification to convince their followers that it makes sense to adopt a sedentary, low-risk lifestyle, and they are wondering if your empire might help.
 
They would be happy to operate your resource extraction sites -- which are generally far from prying eyes -- if you open enough sites for them to bring in their kith and kin. In addition, they will throw in a bit of their ill-gained booty as a thank you for giving them a second chance.
 
After all, there are many keys to wealth and power on Auriga, but harvesting the abundant natural resources is one of the best. Why not gain a bit more, and return some stolen booty to the imperial coffers?</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_ARagingFire_Description">They say that some like it hot. But nobody of sound mind likes it quite this hot. A Fire Guardian, perhaps driven mad in the chains and dungeons of the Endless, is reported to be heading towards your realms. These powerful elementals are frightening as enemies and useful as allies; who knows what might come of this encounter?
 
It seems there are two ways of dealing with the threat -- outright military destruction, or simple pacification (better known as "bribery"). Whichever path you choose, let's hope you can smother the threat!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_ARagingFire_Objective">Defeat the Fire Guardian in combat, or gather enough Titan Bones to pacify them.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_BunkersOfMadness_Description">What new idiocy is sweeping across your territories? Some leader of outlaws has decided it is more effective to position themselves as a religious leader. And, that quickly, the Church of Worldly Gratification was created. Claiming that the act of collecting wealth shows proof of the collector being blessed and pure, all sorts of deserters, outcasts, and thieves are banding together in the guise of faith and devotion.
 
Enough of that! It's time to sort things out, chastize the recently-converted bandits, and let these charlatans know that they are not about to displace the loyalty due to the true leaders of empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_BunkersOfMadness_Objective">Stamp out this cult of greed and hypocrisy by defeating the bands of thugs in the four highlighted locations.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLC21_BunkersOfMadness_Outcome">What an interesting collection of adversaries! Apparently some people will believe anything that a leader tells them, no matter how ridiculous it sounds. Tranquility has been restored, and your troops now have experience with a very wide range of opponents.</LocalizationPair>
