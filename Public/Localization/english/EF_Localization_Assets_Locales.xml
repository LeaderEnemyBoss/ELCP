To do so they recruit, train, and arm lesser beings from the tribes and vagrants that live scattered across the surface of Auriga. Regardless of where they are or to whom they have previously sworn allegiance, when a tribe turns to the Cult it does so until its death. Monolithic, fanatic, and ever-expanding, the Cult of the Eternal End will spare no effort, cost, or sacrifice to see that its will is done.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionGeldirusDescription">The origins of this species are found in a pack of wolves that were driven into inhospitably high tundra after losing a series of fights with the Drakken.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionDorgeshiDescription">Banished after a series of feuds, these Roving Clan families left the life of their caravans and cities, exchanging the luxuries of merchants for the hardships of warriors.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRageWizardsHero1Title">Zarcha Attinul</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRageWizardsHero1Description">Attinul showed great promise even before starting formal training. It was this natural skill that helped her to survive when lost in the Dune Ridges, a situation caused by a coming of age expedition that was attacked by Sand Jotus. She crawled out of the desert days later, a dried and desiccated husk kept alive only by the intensity of her will. Rapid ascension through the rigors of the East Sandsea Hall academies was followed by a departure for other lands; Attinul remains obsessed by the development of her own powers and the destruction of Jotus.
Unusual for an Ardent Mage she has learned skills of hunting and tracking in order to find her prey. Attinul is therefore capable in a number of roles not traditionally attributed to students from the Wizards' academies, such as scouting, infiltration, and butchering game.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRageWizardsHero2Description">Born to the Felkani clan, who inhabit some of Auriga's most inhospitable desert climes, young Asalah quickly grew accustomed to the hardships of Ardent Mage life. With a merciless sun beating down from overhead, and only stunted brush and skinny livestock for company, even the banal task of scratching a day-to-day living inflicted a degree of pain upon the clansmen. Among the young especially, the temptation to alleviate this discomfort was immense. Not for Asalah, however. When she discovered one day that a friend had stolen a plate of flatbreads, rather than seek to share in the pickings she whipped up a frenzy of indignation among her peers, and, with the help of a whipping branch, chastised the perpetrator. In time, Asalah's iron discipline and unflinching honesty saw her rise far in the ranks of the Ardent Mage army, but her ability to unearth the truth from even the most defiant subject did not go unnoticed. Inevitably, she was inducted into the Ardent Inquisition. Nowadays, sickened by the creeping laxity of Ardent Mage society, the High Inquisitor offers her services to any group who shares her attitude towards slackers.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRageWizardsHero3Title">Sunseeker Zakiya Eli </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRageWizardsHero3Description">It will take the sands of time a thousand years to scrub the name of Sunseeker Eli from the collective memory of the Ardent Mages. A political animal who grew the Al-Rubit branch of the priesthood into a powerful force, she is a skilled coalition builder with an instinctive ability to ferret out the secret weaknesses of all those who cross her path. With an immense pain threshold to boot, and famed for holding the record for the longest walk over broken glass, Sunseeker Eli remained a skilled wizard held in great respect by her people. All these feats pale into insignificance, however, as compared to the night she let a Necrophage swarm annihilate more than five hundred of her clansmen. "A gift to the gods," she called it. "An Appeasement of Agony to pay for our sins of weakness." Banished by the Saoshyant himself, Sunseeker Eli wanders Auriga seeking to lead those she views as deserving.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRageWizardsHero4Title">Nahla al-Jazar</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRageWizardsHero4Description">Born in the slums of Gnos-Kalath, Nahla was abandoned by her birth parents before her first night was out, left to die on the banks of Black Iron River. If not for the passing of an old crippled beggar, Nahla's story would have ended there - pecked to death by cranes or snapped up by the fire lizards that lounged in the shallows. Luckily for Nahla, the beggar was no ordinary vagrant but a disgraced and blinded wizard who'd been excommunicated from his order. Nahla grew adept at the wizard's arts, but her mind always turned back to the night of her birth. Why had her mother forsaken her? Shame? Superstition? Simple poverty? The question burned, and when she fought at The Games, the annual tournament beneath Table Mount, this fire propelled her into the realms of the elite competitors. Invited to join the Academy of the Phoenix, Nahla left behind the only father she'd ever known, and went onto become one of the greatest Argbadhs the Ardent Mages have ever known.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRageWizardsHero5Description">To Wadeha Hakan, glass is the most wondrous of nature's gifts. Strong as steel, beautiful as diamonds, clear as fresh water. To think that a handful of sand, fused in a crucible of fire, can become a goblet of exquisite elegance or a pane of colored light!

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRageWizardsHero6Description">Lost in the Arani Deserts after a prolonged sandstorm drove his small Clan far from familiar routes and oases, the Falhala Clan was presumed by the Saoshyant to be dead, scattered, or in open rebellion when they didn't appear at Table Mount for the annual Meeting of the Clans. None of these presumptions could have been further from the truth. Rallying the Falhala Clan in an unprecedented show of strength and unity, Bos√©'s inspirational leadership kept them going even as their numbers dwindled due to dehydration and starvation. A Hero's welcome wasn't awaiting when Bose finally brought them home, however. The Saoshyant, angered by the Clan's long disappearance and still suspicious, stripped Bose of all his titles and wealth and banished him from the nation.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileMadFairiesHero1Description">A talented hunter trained to track over great distances, Pakwa came from a tribe that had the cheetah as its fetish. He was adept at taking long, circular sweeps around Wild Walkers towns and cities, keeping a careful eye for whatever changes may have occurred. A rarity among the Wild Walkers, Pakwa still occasionally uses his powers of the Sharing to travel as a cheetah. 
This nearly proved his undoing, as once when chased by a starving pack of Lycans he was forced to remain in his feral form for more than 12 hours. Plunging deep into an ancient forest to escape his pursuers, Pakwa found a hiding place in the ruins of an Endless site full of decayed and inactive Dust. His presence caused it to awaken, seep into him, and return him to sanity. When the Lycans arrived minutes later, they came face to face with a warrior-god of the forests who slew half of the hunting pack and sent the rest running home.
Wiser for his experience, Pakwa remains the most gifted hunter of the clan, but uses his abilities as a cheetah only sparingly and when in great need.</LocalizationPair>

Hidden among the foliage of high branches, Ipsa, in his viper incarnation, would lie motionless for hours, listening to rhetoric, argument, diplomacy - all the tools of the powermonger's trade. He learnt swiftly, putting into practice what he witnessed to strengthen his position among his peers, until he became the ringleader of the village youths. Of course, by undertaking the Sharing before coming-of-age, not to mention using it in such a dishonourable manner, Ipsa was breaking a strict taboo. His wrongdoing came to light when one of the village elders, head tipped fully back after nodding off in a particularly leaden meeting, glimpsed the waxy sheen and unblinking eye of the viper in the rafters, and screamed in fright. Threatened with banishment, Ipsa impressed his elders with his maturity, expression, and passion during his trial, but was still expelled, perhaps on account of his knowledge of his leader's indiscretions. Today he can't help but lead anymore than a fish can't help but swim.</LocalizationPair>

Frustrated by the Wild Walkers' lack of sophistication, Zaltana left home at age sixteen to seek knowledge. He criss-crossed Auriga, hunting the secrets of the ruins left by architecturally sophisticated predecessors. Infected by Dust in the depths of an ancient site, Zaltana had a mind-expanding experience and many of the hidden secrets he once sought became known to him.

Warriors by nature and necessity, the Lycorns have a pivotal role in the defense of the empire. Joslyn, a third son, left to seek his fortune and soon found himself up to his gorget in fame and Necrophage blood. 
Knighted for his acts on the field of Rilldell, he was madea baron by one thankful duke and soon reduced to outlawry by a less friendly one. Now turned mercenary, he is loved as much as he is feared as a leader of troops and winner of battles.
Deyval developed a reputation for battlefield ferocity, attacking with a certain mad glee. He grew to prefer long blades, which are better for keeping the claws and poisons of the Necrophages away from him. Though not in the least a religious man, he is known to recite some sort of phrase or prayer at the end of each successful battle - a mystery whose secret even his closest lieutenants have not unraveled.</LocalizationPair>

Long did Duke Unwin search the icy wastes, but rather than finding answers, Duke Unwin regressed into the kind of debased creature he'd set out hoping to cure. Returning to his birth lands, Duke Unwin was disowned by his family on account of his hungry, feral ways that had served him so well in the north.

At the annual House Ulsgate tournament, when he should've riding in the contest for the honour of his House, Leofric would often feign injury, gain the sympathy of some impressionable and comely maiden, and then take great delight in showing her his lance. Leofric's world came crashing down in his eighteenth year when, near the conclusion of that year's tourney, his father caught him gallivanting with the daughter of a sworn family enemy. White-hot with rage, Leofric's father frog-marched the boy out onto the field, then made him saddle up and joust with Sir Doran of House Umber, one of the four remaining riders. Sir Doran took the challenge as a great insult, and proceeded to humilate Leofric over seventeen tortuous rounds. A laughing stock, blazing with a shame that dimmed but never went out, Duke Leofric went on from that day forth to become one of the greatest knights to grace the Amber Fields, and now seeks even bigger challenges.</LocalizationPair>

However, when Lord Rowan of House Dain regaled Bishop Julian with the story of a lost Vaulter artifact that could reputedly rebuild flesh, the Bishop found his life transformed. Assembling a party of willing adventurers, for twelve long years the Bishop stalked the subterranean realm seeking the artifact, forging close ties with the Vaulters in the process, while his party slowly dwindled in number. Desolate, the Bishop found his fortunes revived as he became an important advisor to the leader of the large Vaulter settlement, Deepswater.

Drifting through many lands with a tribe of Roving Clansmen, John Port found his facility for overhearing gossip of great use to Auriga's most renowned traders, and rapidly became one of their most trusted servants.

Not for Lord Peyton Quinn though. When he learnt that the most pressing dangers to emerge out of the seaspray in the past thousand years was not the vast armadas of cutthroats or benthic monsters a hundred paces tall he'd imagined, but pathetically, a single rowing boat containing three drunken Drakken whose boat capsized as they stood up to land, Peyton decided to seek glory elsewhere.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileBrokenLordsHero7Description">The story of the Broken Lords has a sad parallel in the story of the de Suluzzo family. Once a prosperous and powerful clan with rich holdings in both town and country, the decline of their physical form led to increased interest in their past, their family, and the "good old days." Commissioning ever more impressive artworks glorifying their past while they wrote and read family histories, in time their number and wealth dwindled as their bodies faded to Dust. Martin, the youngest de Suluzzo - and perhaps the last - gained a driving obsession to restore his family and rebuild his nation. The family fascination with the past manifested itself in the exploration of ruins, and one day Martin returned with his servants from a weeks-long journey with a strange artifact in his posession - and a wild look in his eyes. Since then his energy and charisma have burned like a star, and many see him as a future emperor.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileNecrophagesHero3Description">Saying that the Necrophage Empty Belly was driven by hunger is like saying the rain is driven by gravity - hunger is the constant and inevitable companion of the Necrophages. In the case of Empty Belly, however, the insatiability was agonizing rather than merely annoying, and drove it to constant foraging or constant battle in order to feed. Driven to eat its own young, that act - forbidden except in times of urgent desperation - made it an outcast from its hive.
After Roving Clan hunters chased it off a cliff and into the sea, Empty Belly ended up in a half-submerged grotto filled with broken technology of the Endless. It was there that Empty Belly was impregnated by Dust, brought to self-awareness, and reconciled with its rupture from the hive. The creature that emerged to once again travel Auriga was different from the one that fell in; though always hungry and always restless, Empty Belly is now able to think, act, and plan rationally without being driven to acts of madness by its hunger.</LocalizationPair>

On the cusp of adulthood, one of Never Rests broodmates succumbed to a ravaging disease. The sickness spread through the nest; first workers, then builders, then soldiers fell sick. Every day-night cycle another two or three of Never Rest's broodmates would show signs of the wasting in shaking limbs, stumbling into walls, forgetting their routine tasks. Despite the evacuation of the cadavers, the infection spread relentlessly. Never Rests fully expected to fall sick any cycle, but there was something inside him that kept the disease at bay. As more and more died, the workload for the remaining Necrophages grew. Never Rests became a leader both inside and outside the nest - one cycle commanding a fighting party, the next overseeing the disposal of the dying. Finally, inevitably, Never Rests found himself alone, the chambers and tunnels of his nest clogged with the dead. Exhausted and purposeless, he climbed out and lay down on a rocky hillside, awaiting death. Upon waking, strangely, he discovered a ceramic bowl next to him filled with an amber liquid that sparkled in the dying sunlight. The being that left it remains a mystery to this day, but a desperate Never Rests sipped on the liquid anyway and found himself transformed.

Although his simple mind would not have had any inkling of the changes the consumption of the liquid instilled, Queenslayer found he had a craving for the sweet nectar, and over the course of many day-night cycles, his cognitive function grew fast - and cunning. Slowly, he began to resent his status as a mere servant, then despised it. The weight of the endless days ahead almost caused him to take his own life, before he realized there was a way out. Lobotomizing his queen so that her bodily functions remained intact, Queenslayer became the mastermind at the heart of the nest, fashioning a Necrophage empire of exquisite complexity.

Unbeknownst to the party of Necrophages that Strikes Far led, cataclysmic earthquakes deep in the Aurigan interior had altered the planet's magnetic fields, scrambling their pathfinding abilities. Knowing only the way of battle, Strikes Far and his band of vicious fighters carved a path of death across the land, until they came deep into Vaulter territory. With his numbers finally whittled down to only himself, the Vaulters captured and imprisoned Strikes Far, curious to learn the secrets of the Necrophage's deadly combat. After being force-fed a Dust-enhanced draft, Strikes Far found himself "uplifted" and eventually able to relate his battlefield tactics to his captors.

Trained as a scout and hunter in the deep, dark tunnels of Auriga, she won her tattoos fighting Kazanji in the caverns surrounding an extinct volcano. Making the transition to the surface once the Vaulters started foraging and trading outside, she was rapidly promoted after several famous feats of tenacity and endurance.

The Necrophages had breached her city's second-tier defences, and the order to evacuate was given. After twelve hours of forced marching the elderly and the young were exhausted and desperate - yet still the Necrophages came, lancing deeper and deeper into Vaulter lands. With the line between the Vaulter soldiers and the refugees near breaking point, Istvanka calmly walked back to where the battle raged, picked an ax and shield from a fallen comrade, and joined the fight. Witnessing her courage, the children rallied themselves and pushed on to the safety of Fort Laskolc.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileVaultersHero5Description">Kerre's early life was spent in the study of the many forms of dance. Renowned for her athleticism and amazing flexibility, she became a well-known figure at the festivals and holiday celebrations of the Vaulters. Confident and powerful on the stage she was the image of beauty and grace, adorned with multi-colored robes sewed from expensive cloths peppered with jewels from the most skilled craftsmen. When times turned bad in Gyer, however, and life seemed to devolve into a series of constant skirmishes, Kerre traded her robes for armor and applied herself as diligently to the martial arts as she had to dance. Given her physical gifts and familiarity with extreme training regimes, within months she became one of the most dangerous warriors in the Vaulter lands. Respected for her dedication and feared for her hard-earned skills, Kerre has become a leader among the Vaulters and a symbol of their adaptability.</LocalizationPair>

Coming back from a visit to her Uncle who lived in a nearby Vaulter stronghold, Ajandek and her father had not noticed that a lone Necrophage hunter stalked them through the tunnels. As the creature emerged from the shadows, bare paces from the pair, it had the misfortune of triggering a defensive mine located just off the safe path. Afterwards, shaking - from terror or relief Ajandek didn't know - she informed her father that she wanted to become the greatest sapper in Vaulter history. And she did. Whether organizing defensive perimeters or creating mine shafts, Ajandek is a tremendous ally to have.</LocalizationPair>

In time, through his own experiments in such arts, Gabor went on to create some of the finest armours available in Vaulter lands. When an intrepid Roving Clansman learnt the identity of the maker of such fine plate, he sought out Gabor and persuaded him to take his wares on the road. Five years later, Gabor has learnt much about the world of Auriga - and is willing to share all he knows.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileVaultersHero8Description">Toth Istvan was born in a dark crevice in one of the deepest recesses of Vaulter territory after a subterranean flash flood separated his mother from her home settlement. With his mother dying on the dank rock beside him, it was only Istvan's lusty wailing that alerted the frantic rescuers to the pair's location. While his mother was never the same again, Istvan seemed to grow stronger. Through his childhood and into adolescence, Istvan had no higher aspiration than to be a good Vaulter, and harbored no ambition to become a soldier. It was only during a particularly fearsome Necrophage incursion that his elders witnessed the first signs that they might have an individual of extraordinary fortitude in their midst.
 
The Necrophages had breached Gyer's second-tier defenses, and the order had gone out to evacuate the settlement. By the twelfth hour of forced marching, the elderly and the young retreating first, most were exhausted and desperate. Still the Necrophages came, lancing deeper and deeper into Vaulter lands. With the line between the Vaulter soldiers and the refugees near breaking point, Istvan calmly walked back to where the battle raged, picked an ax and shield from a fallen comrade, and joined the fight. Witnessing his courage, the children rallied themselves, pushing onto the safety of the fort city, Laskolc. After the battle Istvan joined the ranks, never losing the qualities of discipline, calmness, and bravery that he'd displayed on that fateful day. Later he became the High Protector of Gyer, and since the relocation has been restless and unhappy in Budakai. He is ready to do everything in his power for the Vaulter cause.</LocalizationPair>

Her father was a fruitseller, and every day he would set up a stall brimming with luscious peaches, fairberries, and bright round citruses, with all his wares stacked in clever arrangements. Siryi's love of mathematics and patterns grew out of this life, and she would help total ledgers, count stock, and many other things besides. One day she vowed she would join the Clans' mathematical Academy of Tedad to learn the secrets of this realm. In the late years of her youth, however, a long famine decimated her father's trade, and he had to travel further and further for less and less produce. Bandits would steal his fruits, so Siryi insisted on becoming his jarkar, a personal guard. A fiend with a pair of scimitars, many a thief learnt a painful lesson at Siryi's hand, and her name became legendary. One day she hopes to get back to her first love, mathematics, but for now, with her father in safe retirement, Siryi is saving her Dust as a sellsword.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRovingClansHero2Description">Bahas was destined to be a loner. As a child he already disappeared for hours at a time, exploring the land around the clan's encampment or running alongside their giant steeds. After his adolescence those hours stretched into days spent scouting, seeking, and wandering. He soon left home and moved from clan to clan, spending years touring the wide spaces of Auriga. He gained many of his trademark features then: a yellow bandanna, eyes that tend to squint as if forever in the wind and sunlight, and a mouth half-lifted in a perpetual grin.
 
Bahas was changed forever by an encounter high on the cold mountains of Drakkenhome, where he was befriended by an equally restless Drakken who showed him some of the treasures of the Endless. Now an eager seeker and explorer of the mysteries of Auriga, his knowledge of the Endless and Dust goes far beyond what his silent and introspective character displays. For this reason he has been made an honorary Bazi (Captain) of the Roving Clans, able to levy and command troops wherever he may be.</LocalizationPair>

Brave and shrewd, she first showed her knack for command when the trade caravan of which she was part became split from its jarkar-guard unit-during a sandstorm in the dangerous Adoban Wastes. After three days of waiting with no sign of help, Mordicant climbed atop the largest pack beast and roused the frightened traders from their hopelessness, instilling in them a deep belief that they could navigate the hostile sands and find refuge. They did indeed, though fully a quarter of them perished and the rest were forever changed. Known behind her back as "Gharqa" - The Unstoppable Force - Illegra has a reputation for completing whatever journey, negotiation, or project she sets out on.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRovingClansHero4Description">Bela learned young the power of information. An orphan, she survived on scraps and hand-outs she received as payment for ferrying messages between the traders of her local souk. She would watch the recipients' faces light with pleasure or darken with worry as they read the notes, and it seemed a kind of magic that marks on a scrap of parchment could have such power. Determined to understand what these messages said, she learned to read, and soon enough was using the scrawled facts for her own gain. Being a child, the traders made the mistake of trusting her unconditionally and she was wily enough to sometimes take the strategic, long-term view with the knowledge she hoarded. Traders doing illicit deals would find themselves dragged away in the middle of the night never to be seen again, while others became ensnared in mutually-dependent relationships that they dared not rock. In time, known only as The Bat, Bela became one of the controlling Dynasty's most trusted sources of information - a shadowy creature who heard all. Privy to the power politics of the Clans' highest tables, Bela learnt much in the arts of governance, and now offers her services to any race who can pay.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRovingClansHero5Description">Blessed with a silver tongue, Neqra Zeban was born to a simple family of spice traders. He swiftly grew the family business thanks to his amazing marketplace spiels which left crowds of onlookers spellbound. With an uncanny ability at mimicry, a cutting turn of phrase, and a voracious memory of what passed anybody's lips, he could have the crowd gasping in shock or howling with laughter from one moment to the next. Loved by his customers, Neqra rose quickly through the trading ranks and was on course to become the youngest ever Grandmaster when it all came crashing down. Overheard doing a scandalous imitation of the head of the Gopal Dynasty by no less than the head himself (who was in the bazaar in disguise and allegedly buying powerful aphrodisiacs), Neqra had the misfortune of having few friends in high places. In punishment he had his tongue cut out; mute and full of rage he struck out from the city on his own. Today he communicates via a small chalkboard hung around his neck, but he has lost none of his razor insight and makes a formidable administrator.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRovingClansHero6Description">In Al Quereshi, known as "The Queen of Caravans" and the shining jewel of the Clans' empire, there is one name that causes more fear in men's hearts than any other: Jasah Murdap, aka The Chained Cleaver. For many years Jasah lived an unassuming life, one of many butchers in the Great Market selling whole poultry, haunches of goat, and tongue and tail of ox to any who would stop at his counter. A genial man with fine wares and honest prices, Jasah lived happily until the day, unbeknownst to him, he served tainted meat to a visiting dignitary. Embroiled in the political fallout, Jasah ended up accused of involvement in a murder plot, and was sentenced to death by beheading. Jasah's tale did not end there, however. Offered the chance at redemption by the Patrician himself, Jasah life was spared on agreement he become The Last Justice, a permanent fixture of the Great Fighting Pit where condemned men could gain freedom - by defeating the Last Justice in armed combat. As tall as a steed (and weighing almost as much), still wearing the same bloody apron and still clutching the same giant cleaver, Jasah never knew defeat. On the night he took his five hundredth opponent's life, however, he escaped the Pit, and now is one of Auriga's most terrifying blades for hire.</LocalizationPair>

While mapping a particularly promising fault crater, Nachampassesa fell through into an ancient bunker of the Endless. In a moment of ecstasy driven by Dust, adrenaline, and euphoria, Nachampassesa gained a deep perception of the uses of Dust. When he returned weeks later to study and archive the contents of the bunker, he discovered that it had been looted by Vaulters. Driven to rage by this act of thievery and vandalism, Nachampassesa tracked and killed the group through a series of tunnels. The experience was formative in more ways than one; he became both claustrophobic and a lifelong enemy of the Vaulter people. To this day he remains wary and mistrustful of the Vaulters and tends to strike before speaking; a level of aggressiveness rare among the pacifist Drakken.</LocalizationPair>

To begin with he would only watch, his face pressed up against the fence, while juvenile Necrophage fought to the death. The spilling of their pungent fluids would wet his tongue, and he would spasm with bloodlust. It wasn't enough. Hooded and cloaked, Jiraduveja eventually entered the pits himself, fighting the creatures with a double-edged weapon known as a saw-cleaver. Maybe it was his passion, but Jiraduveja evolved into a formidable master of combat. When the inevitable happened, and word of his prowess reached his Loremaster, Jiraduveja was thrown out of the Library in disgrace. He didn't care.

Afterwards, flushed with pride at her part in the successful mission (and with adrenaline), Lakaspassar continued to work for the highly clandestine Reclamation Order, swiftly becoming an integral member of their far-ranging raids. On one crusade, however, deep in the dark places of Vaulter territory where the sun is a distant memory and a Drakken feels ill at ease, Lakaspassar's group was fallen upon by a ferocious band of Vaulter soldiers. They were slaughtered save for one; Lakaspassar barely escaped with her life. She blamed herself for her brethren's death and her lack of foresight, vowing one day to avenge their deaths. Whether she does this from inside or outside the Vaulter ranks is up to higher powers; all she knows is that she will be a mercenary until her debt is paid.</LocalizationPair>

Found guilty of altering a sacred Endless artefact in order to support the position of a Drakken sub-group named the Revitalists, Jayawardene was thrown from the Council of the Eyrie - literally. Tumbling from the tower, Jayawardene opened her wings and soared far from the Drakken's first city, Nahar Tereth, only coming to land when she was many leagues away. Livid with herself, she spent the better part of a year walking Auriga filled with hurt and disappointment, before she recognized the truth of her nature: Her first - and only - calling wasn't love or duty; it was power.

At diplomatic feasts he would personally organise the seating plans, creating complex webs of slights and bonds. When he met emissaries he would greet them in perfect renditions of their tongue, practicing for many hours to get the pronunciation and intonation exactly right. Before signing binding agreements he would alter the wording so there could be no ambiguity, no wriggling out of responsibility. Unbeknownst to nearly all Drakken, his most exacting methods were saved for his investigations into arresting the aging process. Convinced Drakken biology could be altered to dramatically raise longevity, Masargaka oversaw thorough experiments of Drakkenling subjects, hoping to find a way for his race to become true stewards of Auriga through life eternal. When word got out, Masargaka fled, and now seeks to govern elsewhere.</LocalizationPair>

Spending entire days listening at the Whispering Galleries to the voices of days past, Semsa could recount great tracts of Drakken history at loremeets, but would often fail to be up to speed with current events. Determined to learn more of the era of the Drakken's true birth, Semsa battled for long years to be granted a pilgrimage into faraway lands and places, only to be repeatedly refused by The Twelve. At the end of his patience, Semsa left his winged brethren, and now travels Auriga offering to govern anyone in exchange for access to their libraries and vaults.</LocalizationPair>

The fledgling was tracked by its piteous cries soon after it hatched, and was quickly returned to the eyrie. Those days alone in the cold and the hours alone after emerging from her shell left a permanent mark on Namkang, however; she is a traveler and a loner among Drakken, exploring even the most forbidding regions as she is indifferent to cold weather.</LocalizationPair>

In fact, Andom sees not merely the end of the Endless and of the Queen's great plan, but of the universe itself.

As a result, any hypotheses as to the character and capacities of this Hero are meaningless - as the Queen wills.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemBow2MadFairiesMainQuestTitle">Arc of the Builders</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemBow2MadFairiesMainQuestDescription">Discovered in ancient ruins by Zaltana and altered to his liking, this deadly weapon is marked to be used as a compass, ruler, scale, protractor, opisometer, stadimeter, tachymeter, and level. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTomeBrokenLordsMainQuest1Title">Quivering Circlet</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTomeBrokenLordsMainQuest1Description">Though it fits comfortably around the skull, the constant vibration of this silver circlet and its ethereal lightness indicate an ancient and magical origin. Carefully placed holes indicate it was once part of a larger configuration.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTomeBrokenLordsMainQuest2Title">Pendant of Judgement </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTomeBrokenLordsMainQuest2Description">More than a mere pendant, this enormous, multi-piece brooch could be a series of detailed etchings - or a web of almost infinitely small cogs - and is certainly but one part of a whole.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaBrokenLordsMainQuest1Title">Endless Lode Crystal </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaBrokenLordsMainQuest1Description">This beautifully shaped block of an unknown material or element, glowing in a deep red-gold color, is more than the crystal it appears to be. Certain markings indicate it was once part of some sort of great object.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemRingBrokenLordsMainQuest2Title">Sighing Scepter of Auir</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemRingBrokenLordsMainQuest2Description">If you place your ear on this white-blue metal rod you will hear something. Is it echoes of a distant bell, the keening of lost souls, or merely the wind?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaVaultersMainQuest1Title">Deep Diviner</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaVaultersMainQuest1Description">The size of a scepter, this gleaming blue cylinder is clearly the work of ancient peoples - or gods - in that it drains the influences of cold and ice from the armies of the empire and imprisons those effects within itself.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTomeNecrophagesMainQuest1Title">Incubation Orb</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTomeNecrophagesMainQuest1Description">In order to amass the energy which will be transferred to the young in an incubator, this artifact from the time of the Endless draws life energy from those who carry it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemScepter2RageWizardsMainQuest1Title">Transcendent Rod of Verda</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemScepter2RageWizardsMainQuest1Description">This ancient scepter, covered with intricate runes and hieroglyphs, was recently modified by skilled hands. A mix of new and old cratfsmanship and materials, its use can only be imagined.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTomeRovingClansMainQuest1Title">Roads of Dust</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTomeRovingClansMainQuest1Description">This ancient manuscript unveils secrets of the Endless, who used Dust magic to reduce both the amount of friction generated by metals and their weight. Industrial goods last longer and require less fuel, and armies can skim faster across the land.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaDrakkensMainQuest1Title">Spheroid of Drakken Lore</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaDrakkensMainQuest1Description">This strange orb seems to be a globe of Dust etched with Drakken figures. The closer one looks, however, the more it seems to be made of an infinitely detailed layering of models, texts, and diagrams.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaCultistsMainQuest1Title">Order of Isiver</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaCultistsMainQuest1Description">A part of the Unspoken that holds out a hope for peace and harmony, those who have been touched by the Unspoken when this personality was dominant formed a group to advance their particular interpretations of the religion of the Cult. This symbol of their collective will improves the survival chances of troops.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaCultistsMainQuest2Title">The Wordless Will</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaCultistsMainQuest2Description">The Queen may make noise, though buried as she is behind layers of protective shielding no one can know. Instead, her desires are known directly through telepathy and dreams, or indirectly through the actions and demands of her servitors. This particular insignia, an extension of her will, meticulously controls all the details of every being in the army's food, equipment, and mental state to maximize their military effectiveness.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemHeadStrategic1Tier2SideQuest1Title">Casque of the Wanderer</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemHeadStrategic1Tier2SideQuest1Description">It is superstition, of course, that a weapon or piece of armor that sees all the oceans and mountains of Auriga gains superior powers. That would mean that some power is watching over Auriga! Old wives' tales, at best...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemHeadStrategic2Tier2SideQuest1Title">Spikes of Fidaa </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemHeadStrategic2Tier2SideQuest1Description">A strange warrior of an even stranger people, Fidaa was fearless of pain or sacrifice. The helm, which also has spikes on the inside, was said to goad her to acts of unthinkable heroism - or pain-fueled rage.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTalismanVictoryQuest2Title">Generator Crystal</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTalismanVictoryQuest2Description">Incredibly dense and heavy, the recharged Crystal hums with a frightening sense of power. A relic of an unknown past, it is now the key to your success.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTorsoStrategic1Tier2SideQuest1Title">Drakkenvest</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTorsoStrategic1Tier2SideQuest1Description">It is best not to ask if this item was made of dragonskin, or made by dragons. In the one case, they would kill you for wearing it; in the other, people would kill you to get it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTorsoStrategic2Tier2SideQuest1Title">Hauberk of the Vessel of Life</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTorsoStrategic2Tier2SideQuest1Description">Crafted by Jocelynne Uaiah, a world-famous magesmith of the Sisters of Mercy, this armor is said to console and protect both the body and the spirit.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemLegsStrategic1Tier2SideQuest1Title">Knees of the Golem</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemLegsStrategic1Tier2SideQuest1Description">Though this armor earned its nickname due to its relative lack of beauty and comfort, it must be said that it still fulfills its role very, very well.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemLegsStrategic2Tier2SideQuest1Title">Snowwalker's Striders</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemLegsStrategic2Tier2SideQuest1Description">Forged by Vaulter slaves for a Necrophage hero, there were once six pieces to this set. One wonders where the other four may be, as only these two were discovered on the hero's frozen corpse after the Ko-Ek Revolt.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemSword2Strategic2Tier4SideQuest1Title">Eayah's Arm</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemSword2Strategic2Tier4SideQuest1Description">It is said that Eayah was an ancient hero of the Broken Lords who forged this to his torso to replace a lost arm. Imbued with magic and relentlessly sharp, in this case rumor may be fact...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemSword1Strategic6Tier4SideQuest1Title">Starblade</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemSword1Strategic6Tier4SideQuest1Description">Whether luck or an act of the gods, a meteor fell and destroyed a Hurna war party that was threatening a wagon train. This weapon, forged with metal from that stone, also has a reputation for surprising victories.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemSword1Strategic4Tier4SideQuest1Title">The Shard of Icarael </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemSword1Strategic4Tier4SideQuest1Description">The metals within the blade and its crafting style are like nothing else on Auriga. The beauty and keenness of the weapon have led many to speculate wildly on its true origin.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemBow2Strategic3Tier4SideQuest1Title">Nighthammer</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemBow2Strategic3Tier4SideQuest1Description">Long and unusually heavy for a bow, this weapon was crafted for Uaneek Orenda, a Wild Walker ranger who crept out at night to decimate the ranks of besieging Kazanji during the Red River wars.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemBow2Strategic4Tier4SideQuest1Title">The Sustainer</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemBow2Strategic4Tier4SideQuest1Description">Magic or skill? In either case, this bow kept a Wild Walker clan fed through a long, cold winter; blessed by shaman and dominant in battle it has become famed across Auriga.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemCrossbow1Strategic1Tier4SideQuest1Title">Valiant Lightning</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemCrossbow1Strategic1Tier4SideQuest1Description">The crossbow was named by a Vaulter Marine after a long running battle with Delvers for control of underground Endless ruins in Utharan. The weapon seems to have been gaining accuracy and power ever since.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemCrossbow1Strategic2Tier4SideQuest1Title">The 37</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemCrossbow1Strategic2Tier4SideQuest1Description">That is what they appear to be, the tiny numbers etched on the stock of this crossbow. Is it the number of kills? A number in a series? No one knows, and yet, a weapon this powerful should be famous across Auriga...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemShield1Strategic1Tier4SideQuest1Title">Breakwall</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemShield1Strategic1Tier4SideQuest1Description">Strangely, this shield earned its name on an offensive maneuver. It was wielded by Lady Fidense Tulak of the Amber Fields when her unmounted charge broke the Necrophage defenses at the Siege of Gleancrag.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemShield1Strategic3Tier4SideQuest1Title">Dish of Ka-Nuk </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemShield1Strategic3Tier4SideQuest1Description">A worker in the Col-Druk hive charged with cooking the victory stew after the Siege of Volgy, Ka-Nuk and his shield made an unexpected encounter with an Endless artifact. Ka-Nuk went mad, sadly, but his humble cookpot was transformed into a formidable defensive weapon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemAxe2Strategic5Tier4SideQuest1Title">Stiletto of the Delvers</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemAxe2Strategic5Tier4SideQuest1Description">Part description, part joke, this famous axe became known as the "stiletto" when Fest the Hamhand, a Delver hero, succeeded in piercing a Titan's armor with it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemScepter2Strategic3Tier4SideQuest1Title">Junder's Ward</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemScepter2Strategic3Tier4SideQuest1Description">Though scepters are typically viewed as ranged weapons, Junder d'Erwan, a Broken Lord healer, was a rather hands-on type of fighter and in his hands this scepter, though blessed with defensive abilities, was even more effective on the attack.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemScepter2Strategic4Tier4SideQuest1Title">Vengeance of Ko-Ruk</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemScepter2Strategic4Tier4SideQuest1Description">A wounded Necrophage took a piece of battle debris as a makeshift splint. Over time this strut from an Endless ruin melded to its leg, and though the warrior Ko-Ruk died the limb lived on as a deadly weapon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemStaff2Strategic1Tier4SideQuest1Title">Wolfbane the Shepherd </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemStaff2Strategic1Tier4SideQuest1Description">The name of this staff explains its origins. It appears to be covered with tiny nicks, and legend says that one of those marks was cut for every dire wolf head taken by the weapon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemStaff2Strategic6Tier4SideQuest1Title">The Delivering Staff</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemStaff2Strategic6Tier4SideQuest1Description">An heirloom of the Ardent Mages' Bayir clan, this flame-blackened staff was used to great effect against waves of hostile Cultists when a combined army of Hurnas and Jotus archers attempted to raze their home city.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemRingStrategic4Tier4SideQuest1Title">Ring of Unnatural Hunger</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemRingStrategic4Tier4SideQuest1Description">This ring, of black metal with an orange filigree - or are those cracks? - is likely some arcane combination of Dust and Palladian. It is best not to speak of the ghastly powers it confers.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestBeginTurn0001Title">Day of the Awakening</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestBeginTurn0001Description">It has happened every year, for as long as the records have been kept. The places built by the people that first lived here glow and hum in the pale blue light of dawn, and continue these strange emanations for an entire day. Every nation has its traditions and its tales; while one may view it as a holy occurrence or a time of remembrance, others may simply take the illuminated ruins as glowing "Loot Me" signs. Regardless, with the activation of the ruins there is also the presence of a being who seems tied to them. Whether this spirit is protecting them, cataloging them, or repairing them, it would certainly be of interest to learn its secrets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestBeginTurn0001Objective">The annual Awakening is upon you; search the illuminated ruins to learn more of the guardian who haunts them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestBeginTurn0001-Step1">Search a number of Ruins to discover the secret of the entity that haunts them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestBeginTurn0001-Step1Tooltip">Rumor says that the being is more often sighted at Temple Ruins.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestBeginTurn0001-Step2Tooltip">Win the battle with the guardian.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestBeginTurn0001Outcome">Respecting your strength, Eslek Tarosh joins you. More a researcher than a guardian, for millennia it has collected information from the ruins and studyied the changes impacting Auriga.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestVillage#0001Description">The tribe leader wants proof that you are a reliable ally. They have brothers imprisoned in a nearby region, but only vague clues on their whereabouts. Find them, free them, and you will cement the tribe's trust.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestVillage#0003Description">The tribe leader wants proof that you are a benevolent leader who will look out for their interests. As they fear attack and invasion, building a Watchtower should prove that you are willing to guard them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestVillage#0003Objective">To pacify the $MinorFaction in $InitialTribeRegionName, keep an eye on activity in the region to reassure its inhabitants.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestVillage#0003-Step1">Build a Watchtower in the region $RegionName</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestVillage#0004Description">The tribe leader greets you cautiously; many nations use the same word for "stranger" and "enemy".

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestVillage#0007Title">Reliable Ally</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestVillage#0007Description">"Words are cheap." This is the essence of the message from the leaders of the village you have encountered.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0016Title">Within a Rock in a Hard Place</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0016Description">There are enough engravings and diagrams around this ruin that even an idiot could understand it: somewhere in the region an enormous chunk of Glassteel contains a beautifully forged weapon. Only the cleverest among you, however, figured out that this was the work of a smith who thought he could kill the demons in his mind by stabbing a large block of Glassteel. Apparently even the ancient peoples of the planet were given to flights of madness, so don't feel bad if you're having one of those days.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0016Objective">A weapon was lodged within a great mound of Glassteel by a mad blacksmith. It is said that the weapon has interesting powers, and it might be worth obtaining it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0016-Step1">In order to do this correctly, you must first be in control of the region. Colonize the region $RegionName.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0016-Step1Tooltip">Settle a city in the region.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0016Outcome">Bravo! With the region secure and the extractor in operation, you are able to extricate the weapon from the Glassteel deposit. You wonder what drove the blacksmith to such a strange act. You're not hearing voices, are you?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0017Title">Manual Labor</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0017Description">Among the strange and wondrous things you have discovered while traversing Auriga is this new oddity: The Eayaen Bi-Forge. A creation of the Endless, it seems to have been constructed to allow the simultaneous smithing of two different Strategic Resources. While the idea is not overly complex, it is clear that you will require the aid of Delvers to efficiently exploit the forge without continually cracking your head on the unusually low exhaust fan.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0017Objective">To correctly use the Eayaen Bi-Forge, which smelts Titanium and Glassteel simultaneously, you will need the help of a people roughly the size of those who invented it. In this case, the Delvers should do well.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0017-Step1">Come back and search this Ruin with a Delvers unit in your army and a minimum of $ResourceCounter1 of #3C98FF#\7711\#REVERT# Titanium and $ResourceCounter2 of #EAD085#\7712\#REVERT# Glassteel</LocalizationPair>

Though war is not always practical, Chaoshayi convinces you that if you show you are willing to go to battle, you will gain the awe and respect of others.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0018Objective">You have met a Drakken Archivist who has interesting theories of war, profit, and influence. Her ideas are fascinating, especially at those historical moments where war, profit, and influence interact.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0019Title">A History Lesson</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0019Description">Extensive study of the ruins of Auriga tells one story above all others: Even the most powerful empires can be utterly destroyed by the cost and ruin of war. The genius of the Endless could not help them to survive the conflicts they created, and their power and wealth was far, far beyond what you control. This lesson should not be lost on you; it is perhaps time to make peace and put the riches of your empire to other uses.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0019Objective">Study of the ruins shows you the contribution of war to the fall of great empires; if even the Endless were brought down by war perhaps you should reconsider your diplomacy.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0020Description">In a ruined temple, your patrol finds a desiccated body suspended in the air, its outstretched arms reaching towards a cistern of cool water.

What trap was laid, by what enemy, to catch this poor soul? </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0020Objective">A closer investigation of a ruined temple shows a trapped body and strange indications. This is certainly worth pursuing.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0021Title">A Tale from the Dark Season</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0021Description">You have discovered an old text or journal. Historically interesting, the manuscript tells of Samhane Haligtide, an ancient hero who was famous - or is it notorious? - for their ability to regenerate rapidly. Seemingly a skilled fighter as well, the text indicates that this person was buried not far away. Strangely, the tale does not divulge why the hero died, or even if they were alive or dead when buried... 
Regardless, the hero's affinity for Dust means that they could perhaps be revived if a sufficient quantity of a Dust-related Luxury resource is brought to their resting place. While the location of the grave, protected by Dust magic specific to the Dark Season, is clearly indicated, the last few paragraphs are faded and unreadable. All you can see is that they begin with "By all that is blessed, as you love life itself, do not..."
</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0021Objective">It may be worth it to use some $LuxuryName and wake up - or resurrect? - the hero who lays in a nearby ruin. According to the manuscript, the grave will only be accessible during Winter.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0021-Step1">In Winter only, search the indicated $QuestPOI with $LuxuryAmount of $LuxuryName - if you think it's a good idea.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0021Outcome">The hero wakes suddenly, eyes glowing, hand extended. You notice an odd ring on their finger, and a faint sweet yet musty smell like a jug of maple syrup broken on a cellar floor.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0022Title">Colossal Danger</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0022Description">A flamboyant adventurer, Autocthona Smith, has apparently disturbed things best left alone...
 
In a ruin not too distant from your empire, one of the ancient Guardians of Auriga has awoken. Enormous, powerful, and fascinated by the splendor of one of your cities, it is headed for that city with destruction on its mind. 
 
However, you have also learned that even though it doesn't seem to open to negotiation, this creature is also very sensitive to the power of Titan Bones.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0022Objective">Your city of $CityName is no longer a safe place; a Dust Guardian has it in its sights. Who will save your city?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestPOI#0022-Step1">The Guardian heading for $CityName can be defeated in battle; it can also be redirected towards another empire if you activate 2 $Luxury10Name boosters $Progression.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter1Description">It has been a difficult winter. 
 
Not merely the weather and the hunger, but all the rivalries within the Wild Walkers have descended upon the head that wears the crown - your head. During the long cold months, when both space and activity are lacking, tempers flare and arguments begin. As usual, it is the shamanists of the Sokwa clan who fan the flames. "We should not have left the forests, our gods will desert us, we are made weak without The Sharing..." They should be named the Tateh clan, the Talk-too-much.
 
But you are the onontio, the highest judge and warlord, and for now your word remains law. The challenge is to occupy these grumblers and those who would listen to them; they need a purpose and a distraction. Around you are many ancient sites where previous civilizations rose... and fell. To avoid that same fate, it would perhaps be good to investigate these places - and give the grumblers something else to whine about.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter1Objective">It is time to explore and learn. Search ancient sites for whatever treasures or knowledge they may contain.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter1-Step1">Explore the map and search 4 ruins $Progression</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter2Title">2. New Foundations</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter2Description">Time and experience bring knowledge, though new knowledge is not always welcome.
 
Your dream of a great new tower to the stars, a symbol to Gaia, has been put off by strikes and riots at the building site. Achak Adahi, who leads the Sokwa, claims your dreams are foolish sacrilege. He, and many others, continue to insist on the old ways. There are those, however, who have seen what you have seen, and question the old ways as you do. 
 
You must explore, go farther, learn more. You convinced them to look beyond the forests, to seek new ways; it is time to explore farther and find new allies - or new slaves - for the cities you see in your visions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter2Objective">Your empire must grow, and you must have help to do this. Make contact with a neighboring Minor Faction and assimilate them into your Empire - peacefully or forcibly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter2-Step1">In a region that belongs to your Empire, pacify at least one village of a Minor Faction, then Assimilate them.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter3Title">3. Post and Beam</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter3Description">There are always those who bluntly refuse to accept reality.
Achak and his followers are twisting their words in philosophical knots, trying to find some explanation for the things the patrols have discovered. The facts are clear: We are not alone, and we were not the first. One day their disagreements could turn violent; Truthseeker Jenoa is not the only one who warns you of this. 
 
From these other peoples you have heard others tales and new histories; many of these myths and legends contain seeds of a similar story - a story that ends in tragedy. The farther you go, and the further you study, the grimmer and more perplexing the truth becomes. 
 
In one way Achak and the Sokwa are right; your people remain small and weak compared to the vastness of Auriga. Your empire must be secured and your armies developed; no great construction can take place unless your realm is secure. The Sharing, while dangerous, gives you a great advantage when scouting - it is time to exploit that advantage.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter3Objective">You have certainly learned this: Auriga is dangerous. Develop your military by selecting a Hero and building a worthy army. Test the Hero and their army in battle and secure peace in your region.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter3AltDescription">There are always those who bluntly refuse to accept reality.
Achak and his followers are twisting their words in philosophical knots, trying to find some explanation for the things the patrols have discovered. The facts are clear: We are not alone, and we were not the first. One day their disagreements could turn violent; Truthseeker Jenoa is not the only one who warns you of this.
 
From these other peoples you have heard others tales and new histories; many of these myths and legends contain seeds of a similar story - a story that ends in tragedy. The farther you go, and the further you study, the grimmer and more perplexing the truth becomes, though echoes of great secrets and great engineers and architects pique your interest; particularly a thing called "zaltana" of which you must learn more.
 
However, you must start by securing your own region. Other peoples must be brought into your empire, and their stories and tales must be added to your knowledge. Survival will go not just to the mightiest armies, but to the wisest leaders.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter3AltObjective">You have learned at least this: Auriga is dangerous. Develop your military by selecting a Hero and building a worthy army; use it to explore and secure your capital region.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter4Title">4. Building the Future</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter4Description">The truth must be accepted, even when it is unpleasant.
Achak seems to be silent, for the moment. But it is likely that things will flare up when you announce your latest idea: permitting beings of assimilated factions to rise up to high-level posts in your government. If allies can be trusted, why should they not be exploited to the fullest?
 
It is a time of consolidation and reflection, for the knowledge you have gained requires time and analysis before it can be acted upon. But your convictions remain clear on two points. First, that Auriga is a dangerous place that requires buildings of exceptional strength if your people are to survive whatever forces destroyed those who came before you. Second, that the Wild Walkers must be open and inclusive to any and all peoples, ideas, and improvements that can help secure their future. Certainly those who built the ruins had knowledge of engineering far beyond what is known today.
 
Your eyes burn as you read the ancient texts; your ears ring with the debates and arguments of scholars. It has been days since you swung a sword or fired a bow in earnest. But you are onontio, and your people come first.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter4Objective">Now that the region is safe, you turn your eyes back to the internal workings of your empire. Strength and progress will come by building and improving City Centers and building up Districts.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter4Outcome">The cities grow, the empire prospers. You now have resources to go beyond everyday tasks...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter5Title">5. The Cornerstone</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter5Description">It has been a time of great learnings.
First, you learned that Achak Adahi would rather die than admit his failures. He and a band of shaman attacked the palace, hoping to start a revolt. Your hand has not been on the sword hilt much of late, but you still had the reflexes needed to run him through at the door of the throne room. Those who followed him turned to Lycans and disappeared in the night. 
 
Many fell defending you, and some of those were from the peoples you assimilated. You also learned that you command great loyalty. 
You learned, finally, that rumors of a thing called "zaltana" were in fact stories centered around a person - Ahote Zaltana. Tales indicate he was once a Wild Walker, and that he has studied the secrets and structures of the ancients for many decades. He has named them the Endless, for he believes that their works will endure until the end of time.
 
Two things are certain: Zaltana would be of enormous value to you, and you have no idea where he is...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter5Objective">To bring your vision for the Wild Walkers into fruition, the mysterious Ahote Zaltana must be found. Track him by inspecting an ancient site where he is rumored to be.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter5-Step1Tooltip">Send an army to inspect the site marked with a ray of Dust.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter5Outcome">A legend has stepped out of the forests and into your tower. Now, you must grow and exploit that legend.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter6Title">6. Methods and Materials</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter6Description">Half mystic, half scientist, Zaltana is both everything you expected and nothing at all like what you expected. It is fortunate that he communicates with schematics and designs, for when he communicates with words much of it sounds like gibberish.
 
Regardless, the lucidity of his drawings speaks directly to the visions that you have seen - a great base, a soaring tower, a monument to the constructions of the Wild Walkers and a place to weather whatever storms Auriga may bring. But the techniques and materials are beyond what you know, and it is for this reason that Zaltana must first improve his skill, and then find an ancient site where he can apply that ability.
 
Other reasons, reasons that you speak of to no one, have also compelled you to fund and staff Zaltana's expedition. The more you study the ancient texts, the more your sages and searchers plot and analyze the cycles of winter and the occurrences of storms, the more you realize that Auriga seems to be on a downward spiral. You do not know where the spiral may lead, and what the fate of the planet may be. But you are guessing that ruin and devastation will come for those who are not prepared.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter6Objective">You must improve Zaltana's skills if you hope to stave off the oncoming cataclysm. Once his skills are improved, he must take an expedition to discover the secrets of the Endless.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter6-Step1">Level Zaltana and give him the skill $SkillToCheckName (Level $SkillLevelToCheckNumber )</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter7Title">7. The Keystone</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter7Description">Zaltana has emerged, holding designs for a thing whose complexity seems impossible. How can hands build something whose plans are incomprehensible?
In his designs you understand some things, and are utterly confused by others. In that gap between the comprehensible and the arcane something whispers to your subconscious; something that speaks of power and emptiness as endless as the universe. That is a worry in dealing with geniuses: Trying to comprehend them may drive you mad.
 
But if your sanity is the price for the survival of the Wild Walkers, it is not too great a price to pay. More than ever you understand that Auriga is changing; the pessimists say she is dying, the optimists say that she evolves. Even the optimists admit, however, that this "evolution" may be inimical to all forms of life.
 
Zaltana must be encouraged, this strange set of thinking tools he has designed must be created - from Mithrite, of all things! - in order for his constructions to go ahead. And there is no alternative; the constructions must go ahead.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter7Objective">Now that the tools - both magical and human - are ready, the labor must be done.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter7-Step1">Assign your Hero Ahote Zaltana to one of your cities and make sure he has the Arc of the Builders equipped on him</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter8Title">8. To Rival the Endless</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter8Description">The structure Zaltana has dreamed of has been planned and can now be built; models and descriptions have been erected in a pavilion for public display. The sooner construction begins the better, for all work seems to have slowed down as crowds of people visit the models and try to imagine what it is and how it could possibly come to be.
 
Zaltana is in the midst of it all: Explaining, demonstrating, almost preaching. A handful of others seem to have caught on, as other savants and geniuses begin to understand pieces of what that vision may be. But there is only one Ahote Zaltana, and the future of the Wild Walkers hangs on his abilities.
 
Those sages and scientists who still study the planet, rather than visit the pavilion, mutter unhappily and do not meet my eyes when I ask what they have discovered. No one likes to bring bad news to their onontio. The unspoken words are clear, however: This thing they refer to as "The Last Winter" is coming, and it is a race between Zaltana's monument and time, between construction and destruction.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter8Objective">You will have the glory, but only Gaia knows if that will also bring success. Build the Ogmakwan in your Capital City, and hope that it is enough.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter8Outcome">The Ogmakwan is completed; a fitting tribute to an exhausted but fulfilled Zaltana. Hopefully, it will not one day be simply another vast relic of another lost empire on the surface of Auriga...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter1Title">1. A New Beginning</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter1Description">The quakes and fires appear to be over. We lost a city, and are now homeless, but we are strong and remain unbowed.
 
The first step is to secure our new home. To found a city, build an army, and explore the ancient places. For our experience tells us this, if it tells us nothing else: The ancient ruins scattered across the map are places of great knowledge, great wealth, and great danger. For all of those reasons, we must explore and exploit them. With caution, however; any place of great value will be guarded by creatures of great strength. We must not forget this.
 
Exploration will also take their mind off of our condition - and this new method for dealing with it. Dust is expensive and difficult to exploit, but this new way, this draining of living souls to sustain our own forms, it goes against who we are. It violates our principles, our honor. It is everything we have been fighting against. 
 
And yet, it is easy...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter1Objective">Build an army and explore the area around your new city. Carefully explore ruins in the region to find remnants of Endless technology.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter1-Step1">Escort a Broken Lords Hero with at least 2 Infantry \7739\ units to inspect the $QuestPOI</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter1Outcome">You have unearthed an Endless artifact. It is in poor condition, and appears to be part of a larger construction. The question now is how to restore it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter2Title">2. Our Baser Nature</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter2Description">The nobles are unhappy. I understand their reasoning; we try to rebuild our nation and survive the changes in our planet, but the exploitation of Dust is slow and expensive. To simply leech life from others is fast, easy, and gives one a feeling of power. It is a heady thrill that gives sensations of virility and perception - almost invincibility.
 
Marquis Suluzzo is perhaps the worst. Though all the nobles and fanatics seek ancient relics to give them power, the bauble that the marquis has found has given him great strength of persuasion and an enhanced ability to drain life. His speeches make it all seem so easy: Exploit the lesser peoples for our own glory, rule the planet from a position of strength, and turn those who would defy us into weakened slaves.
 
But I cannot accept this. It is expedient, but that does not make it just or right. Sadly, my hand has been forced and I have little choice but to let the sages and alchemists study, seeking an answer that is pleasing to their greedy patrons. We will forge ahead with research and improve our knowledge - though I do it for other reasons. For my part I would see our people resist temptation, even if it presents a risk. There is a reason that the first word of the royal seal is "honor".</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter2Outcome">This is most interesting. As well as discovering great new advances in magic and alchemy, we have also discovered something ancient and powerful; a simple circlet that hums with suppressed power.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter3Title">3. Perilous Frontiers</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter3Description">The power of the marquis grows daily. There are those who whisper in my ears that I should bring him into my inner circle, even make him the King's Hand; our history is rich with examples of warring factions coming together through unexpected alliances. Those who recommend this conveniently forget that there are just as many stories of realms that were torn apart by unions as ill-considered as this one would be...
 
While the nobles and populace watch Martin de Ildan de Suluzzo, I will push ahead with my own plans. Explore, find additional sources of Dust, gain greater control over the nearby regions and peoples - that is how I see our people surviving. Not by turning into armored leeches. A new city is good, and new Watchtowers will help us to hold it. Perhaps I can find a way to convince my subjects that we can survive and grow without this obscene feeding.
 
Perhaps when we explore we will find new artifacts like the Quivering Circlet, which now throbs with power that we have restored and now try to understand. Vinchus, the artificer, has also come up with some interesting notions and unexpected ideas. He believes there is a link between the Quivering Circlet and the marquis's pendant; his studies show that both share repetitive patterns of incomprehensible runes and show similar reactions to the presence of light and Dust.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter3Objective">Imperial necessities mean that you must expand your empire, even by means you do not like. Colonize, pacify, and be watchful.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter3Outcome">An emperor must occasionally accept the whims of others to avoid unrest - such as the demands of the marquis and his rabble. I will grow the empire, but remain watchful and ready.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter4Title">4. A Kingdom Divided</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter4Description">I am trying to take solace in the fact that, at least, the answer has been made clear. The nobles and my subjects have given me an unspoken ultimatum: I remain the king, and place marquis as governor of a great city, or I will be deposed and risk that he takes control of the whole empire.
 
Growth and prosperity. I remain convinced that if I show these goals are obtainable by honorable and honest means, this obsession with draining life will fade. I am perhaps over-optimistic in regards to the venality of my citizens, but if I do not set an example I fear that we will all become bloodthirsty ghouls wearing the trappings of civilization.
 
Growth, development, a future full of hope - these are good messages, but ones that require tenacity and patience. To suck the life from another being, on the other hand, is quick, easy, and pleasurable.
 
We shall see which one becomes the model for this kingdom. Whatever comes of the appointment of the Marquis as the head of a city, it remains my duty to lead and guide the rest of the empire and prepare it for whatever future awaits us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter4Objective">Your subjects and advisors demand that you place the Marquis at the head of a city. Make sure the city - and the empire - survive the rule of this mountebank.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter5Description">Well, that was an entertaining disaster. Strangely, the golden future that the marquis and his followers promised did not suddenly fall from the clouds. 
 
His positioned is weakened, and I will take advantage of that. Officially, it will be a diplomatic and military effort that will offer him the chance to redeem his honor. In fact I send him to pain, if not death, in order to rid myself of him - and wrest the artifact from his grasp. In manipulating his downfall, one could say that I am no better than he is. But I do this for what I believe is necessity; I cannot see a future for my people on the path he has chosen. Perhaps my honor must be sullied so that the honor of my people remains pure. So be it.
 
Vinchus has aided me in preparing the ritual to separate the Marquis from his artifact (and perhaps his life). Far from the city, with only a handful of followers, he will be vulnerable and subject to the same forces that he uses to drain others. I find a certain poetic justice in this, though in that sense of contentment at another's distress I also feel shame. Perhaps that is how the Marquis started down his path...</LocalizationPair>

The marquis seems to have vanished from Auriga; he and most of his troops disappeared into one of the great ruins and neither word nor survivors have come out. Strangely his pendant remained, glowing at the entrance. A twisted strip of endless mysteries.
 
At least the alchemists and archivists are dancing with joy, now that they have his pendant to study. Vinchus states that, beyond any shadow of a doubt, the pendant and the Circlet were once the controls of a great machine. Further study, however, has shown indications of where a missing third piece may be. If the third piece has any resemblance to the powers of the first two, its discovery is of the utmost importance to the empire. Auriga does not release her treasures without a tithing of blood, however. Let us hope the thing will be worth the lives it will cost to obtain it.

The sceptre uncovered at the last site, though not part of the mysterious mechanism, was clearly a key to its fate. When the mechanism was built, instructions on its location and use were encoded within the sceptre; like a divining rod that acts as a key - no mere parchment or stone for our mysterious ancestors. Only Dust, and magic, could reveal the sceptre's secret, and only a genius could make them do so. That is why Vinchus now has both the eternal gratitude of the empire and a stunning domain in Palunbajo. Such efforts should not go unrewarded.

Some of these ruins, it seems are ours; still guarded by mechanisms that we once set in place yet no longer understand or control. Though I am not sure if this makes me proud, or sad.

The sceptre uncovered at the last site, though not part of the mysterious mechanism, was clearly a key to its fate. When the mechanism was built, instructions on its location and use were encoded within the sceptre; like a divining rod that acts as a key - no mere parchment or stone for our mysterious ancestors. Only Dust, and magic, could reveal the sceptre's secret, and only a genius could make them do so. That is why Vinchus now has both the eternal gratitude of the empire and a stunning domain in Palunbajo. Such efforts should not go unrewarded.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter8Description">Something from the past was awakened when the temple was opened. I cannot say what, but in all our cities the Dust seems to have awakened. I understood that we could do magic, but I never imagined it existed on this scale. Something is happening in the empire, and I must exploit it to the fullest. Vinchus came down from his mansion; even he sensed the change. Upon his advice, I will equip a governor with the artifacts we discovered, and see what changes that will bring to my empire.

Whatever happens, we may at least put to rest the question of draining innocent life.

'Has all this been foreseen? Am I merely the pawn of an ancient prophecy, following guidelines lain down by long-dead ancestors? We have discovered a powerful building, something that could replicate the power of the temple within our cities.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter1Title">1. Wide Lands, Wide Eyes</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter1Description">They call themselves Vaulters. They found me scorched and blackened in an ancient cavern that their people had long forgotten. How long had I lain in that darkness? Only the stars know, but my limbs, rusted and groaning, tell me ages must've passed. I will never forget the looks on their faces - haunted, awestruck, but above all, fearful. The realm that they'd called home, the subterranean paths and chambers that riddled the planet, had come under attack from some cataclysmic force, had shaken and split and ruptured, decimating their numbers.
 
Their leader, the First of the Bloodline as she is known, recognised in me something valuable, and brought me back to life in that dusty crypt. For this I will be eternally grateful. I vow to be her faithful servant until the end of days, wherever that may lead.
 
Now they retreat to the surface where they believe they will find respite, where they hope they will find answers. First of the Bloodline Zolya has made the first priority the assimilation of the local tribes. While they strike out into unknown lands under the sky's watchful gaze, I will try to remember past days...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter1Objective">My saviors have retreated from the chaos of the subterranean realm, seeking sanctuary on Auriga's surface. Our first task is to assimilate a minor faction.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter2Description">First of the Bloodline Zolya has taken the first step in securing the Vaulter's future: a strong alliance with a local tribe has been built. Alas, my own progress in uncovering my history has not been so fruitful. My memory circuits have all but failed, and only confusing glimpses of the past cross my electronic mind. I see tormented faces, hear gargled screams, feel the slick touch of warm blood. Memories of the operations I performed? Or something darker? On my chassis is stencilled my droid class: Operation and Medical Procedures Robot... but I am certain I was known by another name. Whatever it was eludes me though.
 
To save myself from madness, I try not to dwell on these matters, instead focus on the plight of my new masters. The legends of their past are awakening. Far beneath the surface, in the excavations that only came to light from the subterranean quakes, they discover more and more ancient relics bearing their sigils. They yearn to unravel these mysteries - perhaps even learn things that will grant them an advantage over the other races that stalk this great planet. First of the Bloodline Zolya discusses these things with the fire of a zealot in her eyes. I have a feeling that their story and my own will entwine.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter3Description">Opbot! My name is Opbot! The name came to me as I performed an amputation on a Vaulter fighter who was grievously injured in a recent battle. The act must've dislodged old memories. I remember living on a great ark. It was a place of light and peace and refinement. Then something terrible happened. My surgical facility was overrun with the wounded. Under flickering lights and dying power I carried out endless surgeries. Soon, the anesthetics ran low. Screams rang through the hollow space, and the blood... the blood never ended. I think something broke inside of me...
 
The Vaulters aren't interested in my ramblings. Their attention is on Auriga. The planet shifts and turns, but to what end is unclear. I sense unease among their ranks. Division, even. Some yearn to return to their dimly-lit underground halls, pray to the old gods, and wait out whatever calamity is befalling Auriga. First of the Bloodline Zolya has other ideas though. And fortunately, she still has the support of the majority. For now.
 
While this support endures we must do what is necessary. Protect our people from the ravages of the Dark Season, and grow our cities. Once we are safe we will have the luxury to discuss gods and visions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter3Objective">Much data has been collected regarding Auriga's changes. We can take advantage of our knowledge to protect us from the effects of the Dark Season and grow our cities.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter4Title">4. Seeking Information</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter4Description">The source of the feeling of darkness inside me revealed itself. I killed. I, a droid built to heal people, killed. All the suffering, all the bloodshed I witnessed must have caused something in my mind to snap. I went on a murderous spree. The instruments used to ease pain became tools I used to inflict pain. Countless men and women died at my hands. Thank the gods, but somehow I was stopped, left for scrap in some abandoned place. But now I learn the worst thing. The Vaulters who saved me are the descendents of those who I murdered. In many of their faces I see the faces of those I cut to ribbons. My shame and guilt burn bright, but I do not have the strength to confess.
 
Instead I will attempt to find redemption. I vow to do everything in my power to aid their quest for survival. Artifacts and relics studied by Vaulter scientists have suggested the existence of the legendary "Argosy" - an near-impregnable fortress their ancestors were driven from after an ancient catastrophe. Many believe it is the key to their survival, that they will be able to ride out the cataclysm within its walls. I believe the "Argosy" is one and the same as the great ark I lived in for so long, and I have told First of the Bloodline Zolya as much. My memory banks still contain some hints to its location, and soon an expedition will be mounted to discover its precise whereabouts...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter4Objective">Evidence for the lengendary "Argosy", a near-impregnable fortress thought only a myth, has come to light. The site must be found... and entered.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter5Title">5. Gaining Knowledge</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter5Description">Stalking the dimly-lit corridors of the "Argosy" has brought back all the horrors in my mind. I remember odd details - desperate hands gripping a bulkhead, a woman scrabbling to get away into a vent, staring at a bloody scalpel with gleeful fascination. The memories stun me immobile, unable to speak. My behavior has not escaped the notice of First of the Bloodline Zolya. She doesn't ask outright, but as we explore the site together she gives me plenty of chances to talk. I dissemble, afraid to tell her the truth. Our bond is weakening.
 
Not that she doesn't have other things to occupy her mind. A few days after we breached the walls of the place, the evidence has become overwhelming that the "Argosy" is much more than a mere fortress. It is a starship. A starship that crashed ages ago. The ancient legends that speak of the Vaulter's journey under the stars was not quite right. The Vaulter's journey was between the stars. They are a starfaring people! Auriga is not their true home. The revelation has rekindled all the divisions in the Vaulter ranks. Zolya presses on regardless. The "Argosy" must be repaired, its missing parts found. The Vaulter's destiny is back among the stars.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter5Objective">The "Argosy" is much more than a fortress. It is a starship. The long task of repair must begin - part of which is finding the missing parts. The stars await.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter6Description">I have told Zolya my dark shame. My mechanical limbs shook as I confessed. For a long while she stayed silent. She told me that this was a hard truth for her to hear, but better that she knew than didn't. She said she'd begun to draw away from me, but with this confession she could begin to have faith in me again. "Will it happen again?" she whispered. I told her I couldn't be certain it would not, but that I thought it unlikely. "You harm a single one of my people, and I will have you broken into a million pieces." After these words she has said nothing more on the subject, and I believe that she keeps my confession to herself. I mustn't let her down. I long to be back among the stars.
 
Not that reaching them will be easy. Already word of the "Argosy"'s existence has filtered back to the Vaulter cities, and many are afraid of what the future will bring. In fact, rebels in one of the Vaulter strongholds claim First of the Bloodline is leading the Vaulters to annihilation and have taken control of the city, crippling the supply of vital resources.

They think they are there to protect me from attack, when the fact is the opposite is the truth. I can remember the peace of the endless dark, and I simply wish to be among the stars again, free.
 
Necrophage attacks come in increasing waves. The "Argosy" is so close to being ready for launch, that I sometimes give in and imagine the violence of take-off - the rumble of engines, the crush of gee-forces, the scramble of senses. Until we destroy the Necrophage menace once and for all though, there will be no glorious escape. They kill engineers, destroy vital equipment, decimate supplies. It is as if they know that Auriga is doomed, know that they too are doomed, but won't rest easy until all the other races are doomed too.

Now's the time to hatch, hatch, hatch more plans. To be a race who can command the surface as we command the dark, we must... evolve.

The hind-legs calls himself Rhiss al-Khali and tells me he is a "scientist" - one who studies the ways of things. His quest for knowledge has led him far from his birth race, and he has roved the surface of this great land learning much. I led him through the teeming hive, hoping to awe him, even frighten him, but his eyes sparkle with glee. He speaks of strange chymistries, and wishes to study how hind-legs and Necrophage differ. He teases me with ideas of a superior breed, marrying the best of both races. The other captives are more afraid of him than me. I don't trust him, but he may be a great boon to us.

Patches of chitin cover his soft hind-leg skin, and only his eyes show the thing he once was. He has asked for a new name, and I have granted him his wish. He will be known as Ka-Riss. I never imagined a hind-leg could show such chitin, such single-mindedness. Maybe his experiments mark our path to victory. Menials! Fetch the hind-legs!

Every cycle I find myself seeking his company over the seething activity of my narrow-minded broodmates. His mind is as fertile as before, but now there is an edge of the untamed in his ramblings. What he truly wants remains cloaked in darkness, but I am beginning to think he does indeed seek nothing more than pure knowledge. He claims he can make us more numerous using materials held by the race known as the "Vaulters" - ancient enemies we've fought in the deep places for as long as the Giver of Remembrances remember.

The noise distracts me from my task! Menials! Get out! Ah, some peace. But a brittle one. Our acts have not gone unseen by the eyes of the hind-legs. They grow bolder by the day, sending out parties of fighters. They will be killed and feasted upon, but I fear for the day they organize themselves as well as we do. They will overwhelm us unless we have the numbers; our attention must turn to a new chamber. While we build it we will be vulnerable. The hive will need to be protected, the enemy scattered from our lands. Then? Then we can truly start swarming this world "Auriga"...
 
Ka-Riss has many ideas for how we might forge such a path. His mind is aflame, painting a blazing trail of the contraptions, strategies, and... unions... we might follow. While his mind burns, his body hardens and bends, becoming more like us every cycle. I never speak the thought, but he may be our future, a hybrid of hind-legs and hive-dweller that marries their capacity to reason with our brute strength. He has become more than a mere broodling, he has become an example. We must learn our enemies' ways, watch them, find their weaknesses... But I get ahead of myself.

Yes, we might feed, but we don't learn. We learn of the enemy by having one of them fighting by our side, or better, letting one of the enemy lead our own numbers. We wait and watch and learn. But how? I demanded. How do we convince a single hind-legs to join us, to reign death upon his own broodmates? You do not know men, he told me. They will betray their people, their land, even their own family for the right incentives. Money, power, pure simple hatred, he said, eyes gleaming as he looked up. He told me there are places - "marketplaces" - where the hardiest leaders from different races can be bought, traded, sold. They will lead your armies and you will learn how men think, he said.

My carapace crawled with anticipation, but before he left he told me something profoundly troubling. It might all be for nothing, he said.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestNecrophages-Chapter6Description">Our plight consumes me. When I rest, instead of the soothing dark that once cloaked me, I am flooded with visions of ruin. Rivers of fire cascading out the depths. Hives crushed into nothingness. Mountains upturned, the land scrubbed of all life, hind-legs and hive-dweller all dead. When Ka-Riss is lucid, a state that escapes him for most of the cycles, he scratches incoherently about a machine - built by the ancients of this planet - that may be our salvation. He is my most accomplished leader in the field, but his mental regression, his slide into becoming yet another savage killer among thousands, fills me with dread. As my mind soars, his unravels. Maybe civilization will be beyond us. Maybe I am the freak, the monster, an evolutionary dead-end doomed to return to the dust from whence I came.

Whatever awaits us, whatever we will become, we must survive. I have decided I have no choice but to submit to his ramblings, let him lead a swarm to the bones of this "Endless" race. Therein lies an "Incubator", a machine that will grant our unhatched immortality, let them live for countless cycles beyond the reach of flame and ice until the the cataclysm passes. We will swarm over the lands, lay waste to our enemies, plant our eggs in every nook, every crevice that we can find, and in time beyond measure, when the stars have shifted, a new generation will crawl out onto a virgin land.

Nothing occupies his mind other than the next fight, the next feed. We are killers. And I? I have found peace with that. We are what we are. And we will survive.

The eggs that we will scatter to the darkest corners of this land will see to that. Before that though, our numbers must swell so that we can send our swarms far and wide. The eggs must be buried in icy chasms, the hearts of forests, desert caves; every habitat we can reach, for none know which places will heal and which will be forever blighted after the winter has passed. By conquest, by gluttony, or simply through the sheer march of time our numbers will swell to meet the task.

I swear, as the stars are my witness, I will find the perpetrator and inflict on them the ultimate penance. And more than this, I will discover my brother's quest: His work will not die! We will stand united, the fiery branches lashing our bare backs, and revel in the ecstasy. Who will join me!</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRageWizards-Chapter2Title">2. Ancient Paths</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRageWizards-Chapter2Description">The truth is we were growing slovenly. Turning away from the caress of thorn and whip and fire. Turning away from the old gods. Turning away from the very pain that gave our lives meaning - and power. I was disgusted by our failure; my brother, even more so. We didn't see eye to eye on all things, but we saw eye to eye on that. He was... searching... searching for something that might arrest our fall and restore our convictions. What, I don't know. Whenever I pressed him he would say "Sister, the truth lies in shadow. When it comes into the light I will tell you all." He was taken in the final contrition trying to learn that truth.
 
I have talked with one - a man named Fisilt - who claims knowledge of my brother's death. He tells me that shortly before Verda lost his life, he was often seen travelling an ancient road that joined two ruins - those places where the Dust whispers. Many avoid this land's old places, believing them haunted by long dead spirits. But perhaps my brother had found something important there? The only way to know is to search the ruins.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRageWizards-Chapter2Objective">The scope of the search party has narrowed. Learn something of your brother's investigations by searching two ancient sites.</LocalizationPair>

Who gave them such instructions, and for what ends, remains shrouded in darkness.
 
Pure rage, pure violence isn't always enough. Sometimes the mind can see further than the eye, and now I wonder what other traps my brother's enemies - my enemies - have laid. There are many other villages in nearby regions, thus many other potential risks and traitors. We must find them, speak with them, and ensure that no other traps have been laid that may catch us unawares.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRageWizards-Chapter4Title">4. A Trail Gone Cold</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRageWizards-Chapter4Description">Every morning after administering my seven repents, I walk from the castellum to the chamber where my brother's scepter hangs, and take it in my hands. The instrument hums with a strange power, as if it is restless, as if it still seeks something. I imagine Verda holding it, spinning it, mastering it. Somehow it holds the key to his demise, holds the key to his work. We will found a new city, populate it with our brightest minds, and raise it as a center of mortification and study as is needed to understand my brother's enquiries. The scepter has an affinity with the Dust that permeates this world, like a diviner's rod channeling ancient forces. I am certain that Dust is key to what my brother sought to achieve, but by what methods remain a mystery...
 
A great temple of science must be constructed, and the nature of Dust, and its link with pain, must be explored. Word comes from outside our borders that other races are afoot, jostling for land and power. We must be leery of these races, protect ourselves from their advances in any manner we see fit, but we must not delay in our scientific explorations. The winters grow fiercer, grow longer, and I fear that one year there will come a final judgment. And I believe the means of our salvation will not be found in thicker furs or higher walls or sharper blades, but in something much deeper, something my brother glimpsed in his agonized dreams.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRageWizards-Chapter4Objective">Found a city dedicated to scientific research in order to better understand your brother's scepter and magic. Gods willing, these studies will shed light on his mysterious death too.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRageWizards-Chapter5Description">Learning - and suffering - proceed apace at Verda's Temple, as screams of enlightenment and ecstasy echo from the buildings day and night. Dust is much more than we ever imagined; it is no simple spice or mineral that we once presumed. It teems, and writhes, and endlessly transforms itself into million-hued aspects, almost as if it was alive. Sometimes it makes a man a savant of numbers, sometimes it makes him able to scale a wall in three bounds, sometimes it makes his heart hammer so hard it erupts from his chest in a crimson fire. I am certain that long ago our forgotten ancestors mastered this Dust, and enslaved it to do their bidding in miraculous ways. We are far from that point, but our path is clear. We have climbed onto the foothills of knowledge and caught a glimpse of boundless lands beyond, but we must keep climbing until Dust contains no more mysteries than does water.
 
But to reach that place, we must know more of the magic of Dust and how it has come to permeate Auriga. We must study the land itself, the anomalies that populate it like gifts from a mad but loving god. And there is something else. One of my Inquisitors, Reza, has made it her personal mission to fully understand the circumstances of my brother's death. Painstaking work into Verda's expeditions and known whereabouts over the seasons preceding his death have indicated that he had established his own private sanctuary... But I move with too much haste. Planning, like pain, must be done with patience and precision. I will let Reza carry on her investigations; once we have learned more of the greater answers, we can more easily concentrate on these smaller ones.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRageWizards-Chapter6Title">6. The Taste of Fire</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRageWizards-Chapter6Description">Every night he comes to me in my dreams. Always the same. I believe it is a memory - well part of a memory - but the mind plays tricks so I cannot be certain. We are children, a handful of years between us. We are walking in the dunes beyond the last tents of our settlement where penitence is offered, the sun hot, the land barren save for a scattering of spine trees. Something sparkles on the sand, and Verda snatches it up. He turns his back, gasps. "What, what have you found?" I cry, curious but enjoying being teased nonetheless. "Show me!" He turns back to me, his hands cupped, eyes gleeful. "With this we could be as powerful as the Saoshyant, sister." He lifts his hands closer... and then the earth shudders, and the sun blinds me momentarily, and when I can see again he is gone, only his footprints left in the sand.
 
When someone leaves you suddenly, without warning, without answers, it is like having a piece of your heart ripped from you. You are not complete. I know this because though the shock of his death has now passed, there is still a hole the shape of Verda inside of me. I don't know if we will ever be together again, but I do know that that hole - that wound - will only begin to heal when I learn the truth. 
That is why Reza's claim - that she has found a way to fix the location of my brother's secret hideaway - leaves the hairs on the back of my neck raised, and the taste of fire on my tongue. Will we learn to tame Dust, and will I gain some peace? I offer extreme mortification, praying that when we find this haven it is much more than a simple retreat...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRageWizards-Chapter6Objective">You now have greater knowledge of your brother and greater influence. Verda had a hidden lab, accessible with his scepter and a specific incantation. But more magic is required to find its exact location.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRageWizards-Chapter7Description">The air was musty, and though the flasks and instruments were caked in a layer of grime the echoes of Verda's presence came to me. The way he stacked codexes, the small relics he carried for luck, the faintest trace of his scent in the robes hanging in his armoire. Reza brought me his chronicle, carrying it in a devout fashion, opened to the last entry. The scrawl was his; spidery and precise. The date at the head of the parchment recorded a day a few scant days before his death. I read:

"I have found myself thrust upon a miracle, the ebb and flow of the Dust inside my mortal body like the tide of a wondrous sea. When it comes, it comes in great waves of fire, cleansing me, before infusing me with the strangest powers. Sometimes the pain is so great a blackness takes me, but regardless of what wounds it inflicts upon me I always come back. In two days I will possess more Dust than I will ever need. I will transcend. I only hope Azeema keeps his word."
 
Azeema. I know that name. A Roving Clansman. A Warden from the Icatha Clan, according to Reza. The Clans? Our distant kin with whom we shared the beauty of the plains so many ages ago? Nothing more than filthy Dust hoarders now, grown fat from their control of the markets. It seems obvious, now - if anyone had discovered the hidden power of Dust it would be the Clans. Had they suspected the forces Verda was about to unleash? Is that why he died? I shall not wait long for an answer. Outside, the lookouts have spied a column of Dervish and Kassai approaching our position. We will smite this army with the fury of the righteous. Auriga will know - and see - the truth of Dust.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter1Description">It has been said, by women and men wiser than myself, that only the gods can know the beginnings and the ends of things, and in claiming to recount a tale one steps upon their all-powerful toes. I dare to say that I have a tale, however, and in the telling of it I hope to offend neither the listener nor the gods, for though there is a beginning, it is you who will see it through until the end.
Blessings, then, on the infinitely wise R√†d√†t, Mistress of Tered and goddess of Numbers, and the quick-witted Tebadel, Master of Words and god of Commerce, and on their families and on their children, and on you, and on yours.
I was born Ahsun ar-Delg√πr in the year of the White Sparrow, called Twenty-third Penitence by the Red Wizards or 1647 ASA by the Metal Lords. The fourth son of a fourth son I knew there would be little of my family's fortune for me, so when I was of an age I set out to make my own, armed only with the wisdom of my Clan and the blazing confidence of a youth who has not yet seen great misfortune. I did in time see it; though I will not trouble you with the tales of those years, of the thousands of yerbat I traveled across this amazing world, of the sights I saw, of the wealth I won and lost and won again. Suffice it to say that in the year of the Silent Dove, known as 1675 by the Metal Lords, I founded this city with a handful of troops, seeking to discover the truths behind certain legends.</LocalizationPair>

With a city established and troops at my command, I felt the present was more secure than it had been for some time. As for my plans for the future, they depended very much on what I had discovered in the ruins, from the past. For upon Auriga, the past is a weighty thing indeed.
The relics I had recovered hinted at something truly enormous - a great complex of wonders and wizardry, hidden somewhere beneath our very feet. Curse me thrice if I did not weep with joy at the discovery! For Dust is not merely our tally and currency; it is stuff that has great power on its own. And should I amass it in the quantities that I saw in my dreams, I was sure that I could shape the very stuff of which our world is made. The ancient whispers and legends I had heard held some grain of truth. But, ah! How much?</LocalizationPair>

With a city established and troops at my command, I felt the present was more secure than it had been for some time. As for my plans for the future, they depended very much on what I had discovered in the ruins, from the past. For upon Auriga, the past is a weighty thing indeed.
The relics I had recovered hinted at something truly enormous - a great complex of wonders and wizardry, hidden somewhere beneath our very feet. Curse me thrice if I did not weep with joy at the discovery! For Dust is not merely our tally and currency; it is stuff that has great power on its own. And should I amass it in the quantities that I saw in my dreams, I was sure that I could shape the very stuff of which our world is made.
 The ancient whispers and legends I had heard held some grain of truth. But, ah! How much?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter2AltObjective">The relics say one must obtain specialized knowledge of the powers of Dust to understand the vast riches beneath the surface of Auriga. And Ardent Mages master Dust in ways unknown to other factions...</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter3Title">3. The Wealth of Auriga</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter3Description">It is said that the open mind profits more than the closed one. Indeed, studies and indications that were brought by these heroes from other nations increased my knowledge of Auriga. And as always, with knowledge, came power.
Next we had to divine, and test, and excavate, to understand more of this world and the ways that Dust has enhanced it. For Dust has always been the rhythm and lifeblood of Auriga, as the market is the rhythm and lifeblood of the Clans. And those marvelous resources, the fruit of a world touched by Dust and ancient gods, would certainly have more to tell me...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter3Objective">Dust is not the only thing worth studying on Auriga. Gather Strategic and Luxury Resources - both for the wealth they bring, and for the knowledge they may reveal.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter4Title">4. The Power of Politics</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter4Description">It is said that blind greed leads to blind decisions. If I was to be accused of any weakness, it would most likely have been that one. However, regardless of what the rumors whispered, I did not then look to gather Dust solely to increase my own treasury.
Scientists and mystics have always been excited by one curious goal - bringing together enough Dust to create what they called a "critical mass". It sounds more like a weight problem than a glorious discovery, but they assured me that if sufficient volumes of Dust could be assembled, the magic within it would awaken sufficiently to unlock echoes from the great Dust labyrinths of the past. 
But I must not forget my people in my rush to amass this Dust; it would be wise to increase the prestige and influence of my empire at the same time as I increase its wealth.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter4Objective">Collect a critical volume of Dust to trigger readings in the sages' mechanisms and resonate with ancient Dust sources inside the planet. But think of your public image; raise your Influence as well.</LocalizationPair>

Scientists and mystics assured me that the physical anomalies so common across the world were in fact produced by an overabundance of Dust and its marvelous magics.

From other peoples we had learned of Dust and Auriga, from resources and anomalies we had learned of the hidden magics of the past, and next I determined that we would bring these things together and unlock the greatest secrets of all.
The Academy of Teneb stated, without hesitation, that the greatest resonance of Dust from across Auriga lay somewhere beneath our feet. What great labyrinth of the ancients had been built? What strange lode or mine of Dust might exist there? Feverish ideas crossed my mind as my body tossed sleepless during the hot nights.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter6Description">It is said that before beginning any project one should be well supplied with logic, prayer, and luck. Yet only the first two can be controlled by us and for the third, the gods must intervene. And so it was, for me; in one of the old places of Auriga we discovered an ancient mechanism that we called the Well of Dust. It was a thing of glorious complexity; equal parts motionless and mechanical, energetic and inert, enormous and seemingly simple.
The great question, however, was this: Could its functions be reproduced or rebuilt? For if we were to build this mechanism that filtered Dust from the air and the ground, the fortunes that I could have amassed would go beyond the wildest ravings of our most avaricious sellers. In fact, to rebuild this in the mercantile heart of my empire would give me nothing short of a mercantile miracle...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter6Objective">In order to understand and reproduce the Well of Dust, our sciences must be highly advanced and the Trade Routes that bring Dust maximized.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter6-Step1">To begin with , we must research at least 10 technologies from Technology Era III.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter7Title">7. Warm Bodies</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter7Description">It is said that if willing hands cannot be found, unwilling ones will do. That was the set of my mind at this point in my quest; I refused to be dissuaded or derailed. Perhaps it was indeed Dust Fever; perhaps one day I would be found chattering mad amid ledgers and scrip, seeing thieves and swindlers in every shadow. 
If that was to be my fate, I thought, so be it! At least, first, I would give my people a wonder the likes of which had never been imagined since the days of the ancients. But to build a wonder required effort and time... and labor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter7Objective">Your dreams require hands - go and find them among the Minor Factions</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter8Description">It is said that dreams are dangerous things, for they drive one to fulfill them at any cost. One could argue that this was indeed my fate; I had forsaken my family and given over much of the ruling of the Clans to others while in the pursuit of my goal. But I saw the final stretch laid out before me, waiting like a well-irrigated caravanserai at the end of a long road of dust and desert.
I was prepared to do whatever it would take to reach that terminal step. That, I suppose, is where the ambitions of youth can take you if they are not tempered by wisdom! Though by now my hairs were gray, my beard long, and many rings of gold decorated my scarves and my fingers. Still, I would not stop, nor relinquish my goal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter8Objective">To gain the most benefit from Well of Dust, you must build it in a city in the center of your economic empire. The more Dust and Trade Routes it touches, the greater your windfall!</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestDrakkens-Chapter1Title">1. A New Eyrie</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestDrakkens-Chapter1Description">She extends her wings, stretching her muscles. The gesture has replaced a simple smile, as she learned during the trip that a Drakken smile induces terror, not harmony. 

Kehangana is content. The city has been founded, and this first step of her duty responsibly executed. They are far from Drakkenhome but that, she believes, was the will of the Twelve. 

Had it been her sister, Prapaheni, things would have been different. They would have halted a scant few days from Drakkenhome; Prapaheni would be too concerned with distance from tradition and not enough with movement toward the future. The Twelve were wise to choose Kehangana first. And this is especially true now, with signs of change so heavy in the air. What to make not just of the longer winters and the earthquakes, but also of something closer to home - the birth of those they call Drakkenlings. Why do the eggs that only ever produced Drakken now producing these things? Why now? Many confusing signs seem to appear - and accelerate. Whatever the answer may be, it is certain that it involves change. And Prapaheni is ill equipped to deal with that.

This first city beyond Drakkenhome will be their hand extended to the other peoples of Auriga. It is a difficult project, and Kehangana fears that it will perhaps too quickly show the strains that lie beneath the surface of their alternating diarchy. Regardless of her own worries, however, she will press on. Not merely because it is the will of the Twelve, but also because it is the best hope for Auriga.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestDrakkens-Chapter1Objective">From this new city you will reach out to the other species of Auriga. Driven by strange portents, like eggs that bear these wingless Drakkenlings, you must learn what is happening on Auriga.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestDrakkens-Chapter1Outcome">Kehangana remains content. They watch the Drakkenlings, they prepare for diplomacy. Convinced that the Drakken hold the key to Auriga's future, she will hibernate, reflect, and dream of the future.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestDrakkens-Chapter2Title">2. Awakening</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestDrakkens-Chapter2Description">Prapaheni awakens. While the smells of the warren are familiar, the smells from the surroundings are radically different. She is upset, uneasy. She knows they were sent to found a new city and doubtless her sister, Kehangana, interpreted the commands a bit too liberally. It is irresponsible to travel so far from the Twelve, so far from Drakkenhome. Though physical distance is easily conquered with wings, what Prapaheni fears is distance from tradition. Without tradition, without structure, will they not descend into the forms of their most ancient ancestors, before They came, and revert to barbarism?

The first step is to contact other peoples, and bring them the benefits of Drakken wisdom and power. The Drakken must impose their values, by influence or by force, lest the other beings of Auriga stray from the great principles that They once set down: Protection, stewardship, preservation. In a later time they must also think of a Nursery; the new Drakken city will need more of their people, even if they are those alien Drakkenlings, to propogate their message and maintain their customs.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestDrakkens-Chapter2Objective">The Drakken survived milennia on a planet wracked by cataclysm; their wisdom must be disseminated. Build your Influence to spread diplomatic messages, and prepare troops for those who will not listen.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestDrakkens-Chapter3Title">3. Resolutely Forward</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestDrakkens-Chapter3Description">Kehangana awakens, and sees that Prapaheni has not been idle. 

Their prestige and influence grow; sadly, the military grows as well. Prapaheni turns too easily to aggressive methods in order to achieve her goals. Regardless, it is now Kehangana's time, and she will not waste it. 

The passing of Chamewhana into the Whispering Galleries is an inevitable part of the cycle of Auriga; Kehangana refuses to view it as an omen and simply gives reverence to the one who has passed on.

The priority is to a new Nursery; they must study and prepare for a wondrous if unpredictable future among the peoples of Auriga. Kehangana cannot believe that retreating into ancient tradition and hidebound ways will help them face the changes that are coming; it is not in dogma that the Drakken will find flexibility and adaptation. Science, patience, study, diplomacy, growth - these are the ways that the Drakken have always coped with change, and they will certainly serve well in these uncertain times.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestDrakkens-Chapter3Objective">To continue their efforts, eggs must drop and incubate or the city will wither. Technologies must be learned and resources collected to build an Oologic Nursery in these unfamiliar lands.</LocalizationPair>

The sights and sounds of the Oologic Nursery give some solace in this strange place, but she feels the same gnawing unease as her sister. Doubtless They had many means to listen and study the planet, but the knowledge of these ways disappeared when They warred upon Themselves. 

She is loathe to inspect ruins and desecrate Their remains; the very thought is unpleasant to Prapaheni. Instead, she decides to work methodically through the many minor peoples they have encountered, speaking to their scouts and their wise men to see what information they have gleaned. This is and always will be the role of the Drakken: To protect and guard the lesser peoples, to maintain things as they are in a world of chaotic change.

Why else could They have left the Drakken as stewards of Their home?

Regardless, the artifact must be studied and understood. Assumptions made from cursory glances and uninformed readings must be countered by careful analysis done by the wise and the experienced.

Initially, however, Kehangana must rebuild the morale of her people; little can be done to advance their cause if the eyrie is divided and unsure.

The loremasters have discovered much during the years she slumbered. The Drakkenlings, for instance, were planned from the beginning; They foresaw a time when war between empires would erupt. Written into the cells of the Drakken were the messages that would trigger the hatching of a footsoldier unit when war became generalized necessity. This much They saw: The future of Auriga would be uncertain, but certainly violent. 

The loremasters also speak of the ancient war when They fought among Themselves. Two camps, apparently, broke apart and brought death upon each other. One used weapons of lightning and fire that struck the body, the other devised weapons that worked on the mind and soul. What monsters, then, were They...? A shaken Kehangana would like to know.

It was cold and terrifying; it preached and promised - as all the powerful ones do. But this was different. These Cultists want to convert, invade the old places, and cover the world with their believers. But who is insane enough to dream of ruling a world? This Cult. It told us about a vengeance of centuries, and asked us to join their terrible purpose.

As long as I still control my thoughts I will fight for the future and the safety of my tribe. No cult or army will change that. And never one full of such strangeness, dedicated to an insane cause.

They execute the plan they spoke of when they first crushed us. Build strength, seek knowledge, spread across Auriga. That's how it is with fanatics; a speech is not just words but an oath, and the Cult is happy to die fulfilling that oath.

I don't need to be told that the final steps are coming. It is in the air - in the voices that crack, in the hurried movements. But I want no part of this.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter1Title">1. The beginning...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter1Description">Is the end of Auriga coming near? Cracks begin to appear in the planet's crust, particularly in those places where ancient sites of the Endless were dug particularly deep. It is hard to say if it is the work of the Endless, or of some greater spirit, but at five of the most affected sites great beams of Dustlight illuminate the planet as far as the eye can see.
 
Explorations of these locations show a vast network of tunnels, rooms, and storehouses; as your explorers investigate they also seek to better understand this ever-stranger world on which they live.
 
It is a race against time to understand the cracks and the ruins for if the end is coming, you certainly have work to do for your people.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter1Objective">Auriga is in movement; it is time to go and figure out why.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter1AltDescription">Work on the Argosy has ground to a halt. While much has been learned, and much done, certain problems will require enormous time and effort: The cracks in the hull, a failed energy source, broken life support systems...
 
Yet now, as the Vaulter people begin to lose faith, it seems the Great Orrery has other plans for you. 
 
Cracks begin to appear in the planet's crust in places where the Endless had excavated their deepest ruins. But beyond that, and stranger still, at five of these sites great beams of Dustlight reach up, illuminating the planet as far as the eye can see.
 
Explorations of these locations show a vast network of tunnels, rooms, and storehouses. As your explorers investigate, they also seek to better understand this ever-stranger world on which they live. The sites are infested by beasts and roaming armies; it appears that gaining acces to these places will not be so easy.
 
It is a race against time to understand the cracks and the ruins for if the end is coming, you certainly have work to do for your people. And as all the other peoples of Auriga see the same lights, they are sure to be curious as well!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter1AltObjective">Auriga is in movement; it is time to go and figure out why.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter1Alt-Step1">Search one of the ruins illuminated by a giant Dustlight with at least an army of 6 units of Level 4 led by a Hero of Level 9.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter2Title">2. A Pretty Riddle</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter2Description">The mysteries of Auriga are as numerous as they are frustrating. This one is greater, however; never before has the surface broken open to expose its core. To understand what has happened and why will require securing the area while you mount a well-equipped expedition for to do in-depth exploration and analysis. 
 
It is at least clear that the great underground labyrinths were more than just storehouses; given the strange equipment and specimens it seems that Auriga was at one time a warren of interconnected laboratories. Sadly, there is little time left to pursue these discoveries as more pressing problems arise. For one, Minor Factions in the affected regions are sure of a coming apocalype, or catastrophe, or some sort of event that shamans describe with ever greater adjectives of horror and destruction. Whether they are correct or not, the tribes and peoples are up in arms against any and all armies.
 
And you must find your own answers to this theoretical apocalypse. Is the planet cracking apart, are the long-dead technologies of the Endless sending a final message, or is the soul of the planet making you an offering?
 
There are many interpretations; you must find your own truth.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter2Objective">Secure the region long enough for a team of scientists to explore the fissured Ruins.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter2-Step1">Make sure there is no enemy army in the region $POIRegionName at the end of $Timer turns, including Minor Faction armies from $POIRegionName. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter2-Step1Tooltip">Note: Enemy armies include roaming armies from Minor Factions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter2Outcome">The team is assembled, the equipment prepared, and the region stable enough for supply lines. All that remains is to descend. And survive.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter3Title">3. Below</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter3Description">This is unheard of. Is it science beyond magic, or magic beyond science? It comes from a place of the Endless, yet holds some enormous... thing ... that is entirely different from the ruins and artifacts seen so far. Alchemists, wizards, and scientists divide their time between swooning with excitement and arguing with vigor about obscure materials and designs.
 
And once again other problems arise to distract you. Though the Minor Factions are to some degree pacified, armies of some sort of servant or guardian now pour from the Dust-lit ruins. They are ugly, misshapen things, hardly the work of the Endless who came before. Or, perhaps more worryingly, the work of certain Endless under terrible stress in a moment of desperation...
 
Thus the little that is clear does not make things easier. The vessel is certainly some means of transport, with seats and beds, yet without wheels or runners. One's mind shies away from the conclusion; sanity is not compatible with the idea that it could be a vessel to take one elsewhere - into the air, even beyond?
 
You cannot know until it can be activated and explored. Simple designs and schematics show a crystalline power source that lies elsewhere, beneath one of the other Dustlights, collecting energy. It must be found and returned here for the mystery to be solved.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter3Objective">Whatever this vast behemoth is, it will lie dead until its source of energy is returned. You must seek it at one of the other sites illuminated by the Dustlights; beware of the ancient guardians who rise up to protect them!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter3-Step1">The energy source must be in one of the other ruins illuminated by the giant Dustlights. Search the other Ruins to find it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter3-Step1Tooltip">Start searching the other Ruins illuminated by the giant Dustlights. Good luck!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter3Outcome">Eureka! Or not. We have found the vessel's energy source, but it is clearly dead. It will be usable, I am told, once it is repaired...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter4Title">4. Hardware</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter4Description">The materials of which this energy crystal was made can be found - even improved upon - by the wondrous natural resources of Auriga. To that end, we must seek and scrape to bring together enough magic and metal to repair it.
 
Other disturbing news comes in. Firstly, that the vast living spaces beneath the surface were certainly biological testing laboratories. It seems that Auriga was one gigantic research center, with strange new species of all sorts created below the surface, then released above. Was this proliferation of beasts what eliminated the Endless from their own planet? And why does it appear that all the vats, silos, cages, habitats, and tubes were opened from within and their contents released?
 
These questions threaten to delay us, and our quest is urgent. Resources must be found to repair the crystal, though as we drive headfirst into this project nobody has really stopped to ask the question: Are we sure we want to do this?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter4Objective">The energy crystal must be repaired. To do this, you will need to gather specific Strategic Resources.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter4-Step1">Search the Ruins again in $RegionName once you have collected $ResourceCounter1 of $StrategicResource1to3 and $ResourceCounter2 of $StrategicResource4to6</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter4-Step2">Wait $Timer turns for the energy crystal to gain its full charge. Then search the Ruins again to take the crystal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter4-Step2Tooltip">Patience is sometimes an exasperating virtue.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter4Outcome">It is an unexpected pleasure when projects go according to plan. Now that the energy crystal is repaired and fully charged, little is left to do but take the final step.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter5Title">5. Departure</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%VictoryQuest-Chapter5Description">We are ready, but perhaps unprepared. It is one thing to leave a village or travel to a new region. But to depart from a planet, with little understanding of where or how we will go, is hardly reassuring. The sages assure me that the ship will guide us safely to a new home; the governors are preparing great stores of food and materials for the trip.
 
In leaving, we depart from a place that we thought of as "home" and ourselves as its occupants. It is somehow easier to leave knowing that it was more a laboratory, and we merely the descendants of its specimens. Do we feel kinship more with those who experimented on our ancestors, or those who broke open the locks and released their own experiments upon them? Each nation, each person must make this choice to come to grips with their past, as we take a great leap into our own future.
 
A sage assured me that this is similar to taking any great risk: You jump off a cliff and learn to fly on the way down. Or, in this case, on the way up...</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestTutorial-Title128">More Heroes</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestTutorial-Content128">In normal games, more advanced features will be revealed through the unlock of new Technologies or by dealing with other empires.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestTutorial-Content135">To be of use, a Hero \7764\ has to be assigned to an army as a General or to a city as a Governor. Depending on their profile and their Hero Skills they will give different bonuses to their army or city.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction04">cold and gray....</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction05">Devastated </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction06">and dying.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction07">Now I am alive again, </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction08">but I fear my new children imitate the old ones.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction09">Some claim the mountains or the forests, </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction10">or build fortresses on the plains.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction11">They begin to mistrust, </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction12">and prepare for war...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction13">Still, I love them as only a mother can.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction14">And now I fear for them. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction15">I feel the winds of change begin to blow...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction16">... And this time it may be an all-out storm.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction17">I pray that my children will weather this tempest; ...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction18">... for nothing is immortal, </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction19">and one day </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction20">they may have to survive without me...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies01">It is coming...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies02">I am convinced.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies03">Now, I must convince the others.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies04">We have seen the longer winters ...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies05">... We have felt the limits of the Sharing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies06">Our planet is changing,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies07">we must change with it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies08">We must leave the forests, start again, 
explore and reach out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies09">We must find new ways.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies10">Adapt. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies11">Learn.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies12">For if not,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies13">we will perish.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies14">And that will not happen</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies15">while I wear the crown.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesBrokenLords01">We were different, once.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesBrokenLords02">We fought, drank, and loved</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesBrokenLords03">as mortal beings.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesBrokenLords04">But our world changed and we faced a stark choice:</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesBrokenLords05">Alter our bodies, or perish.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesBrokenLords06">Yet "survival" is not the same as "life".</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesBrokenLords07">Now we are prisoners of the armor that binds us and the Dust that sustains us. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesBrokenLords08">We must drain Dust, drain energy, or die...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesBrokenLords09">Where is our honor now, Lords of the Amber Plains?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesBrokenLords10">And what matters more</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesBrokenLords11">- to reclaim our honor,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesBrokenLords12">or sustain</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesBrokenLords13">our bodies?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesNecrophages01">The colony was everything.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesNecrophages02">They were born as one,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesNecrophages03">they fought as one,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesNecrophages04">and they died as one...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesNecrophages05">...driven by their hunger.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesNecrophages06">But I hunted for something more...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesNecrophages07">I stole the sentience of an ancient power,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesNecrophages08">and saw a greater purpose.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesNecrophages09">For we were the first; Auriga is our planet.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesNecrophages10">And I will turn our hunger against those trespassers who would take it from us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesNecrophages11">One day, we will reign supreme on Auriga.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesNecrophages12">And we will gaze up at the stars,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesNecrophages13">still hungry...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters01">Our legend spoke of a great journey beneath the stars.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters02">Safe in our halls and mines we ignored these old tales.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters03">But then the Great Quake cracked our halls open</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters04">revealing ancient secrets and relics.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters05">Those unknown relics carried our patterns,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters06">our images,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters07">hints of a hidden past.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters08">We took them and fled the destruction</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters09">seeking a new life on the surface.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters10">Now the legends and relics of our past 
show the way to our future.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters11">The journey will be dangerous, sometimes deadly,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters12">but we go forth without fear or ignorance,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters13">for "courage" and "knowledge" are the bywords of the Vaulters.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards01">They are weak. They are soft.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards02">They writhe in supposed discomfort at minor penances </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards03">that the faithful would not even notice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards04">Their sloth will be their undoing; </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards05">without the pain, they cannot touch the power.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards06">Use your eyes! </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards07">Or I will remove them in atonement. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards08">See that Auriga herself writhes in anguish - as we all should.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards09">Join me in contrition and mortification</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards10">such as Auriga has never seen.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards11">Together we will embrace the agony, and make it our servant.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans01">Some hope to control their destiny by building. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans02">Others through science, or by conquest.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans03">Do they not see that only Dust can give them what they want?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans04">For it is money and power and magic, </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans05">all intertwined in a single, miraculous substance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans06">It is the essence that binds our civilizations together.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans07">Perhaps, as we let them believe, it is our weakness.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans08">But I have seen its wonders.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans09">It is not our weakness; </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans10">it is rather, how we will rule them all.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens01">We have always been here. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens02">The Whispering Galleries have always held the memories of our people.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens03">Then They came, and They lifted us up. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens04">But They fought, and They fell. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens05">Our world was swept by cataclysm, </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens06">and we were left alone.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens07">Still, we persevere, protect, and maintain, as we always have.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens08">We may lack Their sight and Their knowledge, </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens09">but we can still read the omens.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens10">Another cataclysm is coming and it is we,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens11">the Drakken,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens12">who must save the world of Auriga.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists01">The Endless broke us when they broke themselves.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists02">Now we are few,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists03">and many that remain are often of little use.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists04">Yet our purpose still drives us</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists05">even death cannot be allowed to stop us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists06">We must find new converts, new servants,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists07">who will help us fulfill the great oaths we took so long ago.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists08">They will not only be our hands and our eyes,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists09">they will be the sword and the shield 
of our armies that will bring the Eternal End.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists10">First upon Auriga,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists11">and then across the universe.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGreetings">Greetings. Let us see if our empires can live together in harmony.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGreetings_BrokenLords">Hail to your grace! Let us hope that we become honorable acquaintances.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">Common friends and allies make for a hopeful future. Auriga is in good hands.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">Your recent expansion is not a problem for us, as long as Auriga is big enough for both of us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">This war has gone on long enough, wouldn't you agree?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetPositive_Occurrence1">We have had conflicts in the past, but wise leaders must learn to forgive.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">This surprise attack can only be seen as a betrayal! We hope this does not happen twice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">We have captured your city; perhaps now you see that it is in your interest to end this war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">You have taken a city and gotten what you wanted. If you now put aside your lust for conquest, we could end this war.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">War brings us together, as we now have a common enemy to fight.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">Common friends indicate that we have common goals and ambitions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">Our common friend joins the alliance; it is a good day for Auriga.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">Please note that you are encroaching on sovereign territory. And I am the sovereign.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">All this cost, all this blood... We hope you realize what you've done.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNeutral_Occurrence1">Our past wars were based on past problems. Perhaps wise leaders would forget, and start afresh?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">That was a direct provocation! You should be more careful of your actions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">Capturing the city was an act of justice, not brutality.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">However this conflict ends, we will not forget the citizens of the city you captured.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">We can't imagine what foolishness you are plotting, but we wouldn't recommend a frontal approach.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">Your army may be powerful, but there is more to war than brute strength.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">If I were in your shoes, I'd pay a bit more attention to the details of my empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">It seems that our empires could learn from each other.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">We don't know what you're planning, but we do know your troops should leave my territory.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RageWizards">The long, drawn-out pain of #F3EAD8#war fatigue#REVERT# is not useful to our studies; perhaps we should think of bringing an end to the conflict.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RageWizards">We have #F3EAD8#taken your city#REVERT#; perhaps now you see that war against those who wield Dust magic is hopeless.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RageWizards">You have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT# and gotten what you wanted. If you can put aside your lust for conquest, we could end this war and return to our studies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RageWizards">As we achieve greatness in powers of the mind, we see with #F3EAD8#your great military power#REVERT# you dominate other fields.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RageWizards">Our wisdom and dedication is why we are the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#. We are curious what is the source of your surprising weakness.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RageWizards">It is our hope that through study and sacrifice we may one day be like yours, the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RageWizards">You wish to learn some of our powers over Dust? Is that why you send #F3EAD8#troops in our territory#REVERT#?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RageWizards">We are content that our relations are #F3EAD8#peaceful#REVERT#. We trust you don't plan to change this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RageWizards">Our #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT# gives us reason to believe that our empires may not need to fall into conflict.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RageWizards">We share #F3EAD8#common friends#REVERT#. This may mean that we are unlikely to fight each other.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RageWizards">We now have a #F3EAD8#common ally#REVERT# in our alliance; with luck this will lead to better relations and greater wisdom.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RageWizards">Our #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT# could lead to harmony, or conflict. Think of which is in your best interest.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RageWizards">The war has distracted and ruined us all; perhaps you should think twice about continuing this #F3EAD8#war fatigue#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNeutral_Occurrence1_RageWizards">The wind has blown and the sand shifted since our #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT#; perhaps we too should start anew.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RageWizards">Your unruly violence is noted; we are not so lost in the pain that we don't see your #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RageWizards">We are #F3EAD8#taking your city#REVERT#, and its people will learn to reach through their pain into a higher state of being. Should we do it again?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RageWizards">You have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT#, and its mages are denied their rituals and equipment. They may weaken, but they will not be forgotten.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RageWizards">The armies of our mages wield the #F3EAD8#greatest military power#REVERT#. It is in your interest to see that relations stay cordial.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RageWizards">Your armies and #F3EAD8#your great military power#REVERT# impress all, but they will not drive us to act in fear or cowardice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RageWizards">We see and learn much, and see that you are frail while we are the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#. Be warned that Auriga is a dangerous place for the weak.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RageWizards">Your great leadership has given rise to what is now the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#. Be careful of what you do with it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RageWizards">Your #F3EAD8#troops in our territory#REVERT# have been spotted; even if they come as friends we prefer they keep their distance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RageWizards">Though your latest actions are #F3EAD8#peaceful#REVERT#, the winds have not yet erased the traces of your previous ones. We are on our guard.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RageWizards">We salute your choice of enemies. However, sharing a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT# does not mean we suddenly share hopes and dreams.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RageWizards">We wonder if we should tell our #F3EAD8#common friend#REVERT# about you, and save them the pain, or let them live it and learn themselves.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RageWizards">So we have a #F3EAD8#common ally#REVERT#? We will watch closely, and perhaps learn some of your skills in treachery and deceit.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RageWizards">We note that you take more land with a #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT#. We look upon our shared frontier as a line of risk, not a point of exchange.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RageWizards">The war takes lives and lifetimes, and drains us with #F3EAD8#war fatigue#REVERT#. No matter, we will continue until our bones or yours decorate the vast sands.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNegative_Occurrence1_RageWizards">The #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT# left scars upon us; we thank you for the beautification but will not forgive you for the act.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RageWizards">We do not forgive you this act of #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#, and we do not fear the consequences of what we say.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RageWizards">The mages have #F3EAD8#taken your city#REVERT#. Now you begin to see the power of pain, don't you?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RageWizards">Until the end of time we will remember that you have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT#. The penance we exact from you will be horrific.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RageWizards">While we grow in power and the wisdom of Dust, you shrink into an ever more pathetic empire with a #F3EAD8#weak military#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RageWizards">Though #F3EAD8#your great military power#REVERT# may threaten Auriga, your base and vile exploitation of it demands only contempt.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RageWizards">Lumbering thieves in your uniform have penetrated our territory. If they do not leave they will be perforated, not penetrated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceProposed_RovingClans">The price of supplies has gone through the roof! Let's end this costly #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# with a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceSigned_RovingClans">End the #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#? Prepare a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT#? We would be glad to negotiate that...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceRefused_RovingClans">No #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# for us. The war has not yet exhausted our troops or our coffers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceDeclarationSigned_RovingClans">We think that a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# is good for business. We are taking the liberty of imposing it on you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceDeclarationAcknowledged_RovingClans">Hardly a fair barter - you end a #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# with a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# we can't discuss!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToColdWarSigned_RovingClans">If #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# was profitable, we'd prefer it. With you, #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# is a better deal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToColdWarAcknowledged_RovingClans">You #F3EAD8#force#REVERT# #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# upon us? As we say: You never know what an unhappy customer might get up to.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToColdWarSigned_RovingClans">What an expensive #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# this is! We think the wages of #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# suit us better.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceToWarAcknowledged_RovingClans">So you change from #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# to #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#? Ah, we'll see if you are prepared to pay the price.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToWarSigned_RovingClans">#F3EAD8#Cold war#REVERT# is not enough. The price for your attitude is #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToWarAcknowledged_RovingClans">#F3EAD8#Cold war#REVERT# is over? Very well. We too are ready to mint coins in the heat of #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToWarSigned_RovingClans">We find this boring #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# lacks volatility. Let us seek new markets in a state of #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToWarAcknowledged_RovingClans">If you starve for #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#, we have an adequate supply on hand!</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToWarAcknowledged_RovingClans">You break an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# to start a #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#! Why ever did we ally ourselves with such fools?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceProposed_RovingClans">#F3EAD8#Cold war#REVERT# ill suits our coffers. How do you feel about #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# between us?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceSigned_RovingClans">A toast! Let us drink ros√© from north of the Gap as we go from #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# to #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceRefused_RovingClans">#F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT#? Never! You take us for an easy mark, don't you?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceProposed_RovingClans">This #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# seems to poorly serve our mutual profit. We suggest #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# would be better.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceSigned_RovingClans">You do not respect our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#? #F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT#, at least, carries the hope of some benefit.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceRefused_RovingClans">We do not seek #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#; we far prefer the connections and contacts of an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceAcknowledged_RovingClans">We grow richer in an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# than we do at #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#. Strange that you insist on this change.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceDeclarationSigned_RovingClans">We have reasons to prefer being at #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#. You're a bright one; you'll figure it out.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceRefused_RovingClans">We do not see why an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# would be more interesting that our current #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceDeclarationSigned_RovingClans">#F3EAD8#Cold war#REVERT# is expensive and inconvenient; we insist on an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged_RovingClans">From #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# to #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# is generally a long journey, not this quick trip.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationSigned_RovingClans">#F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT# is not beneficial; we have decided to form an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# from which you will gain great profit. Trust me.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged_RovingClans">We don't have a choice; we #F3EAD8#join#REVERT# your #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#. But there is more to running a caravan than simply loading the beasts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealProposed_RovingClans">Will you take advantage of our almost irresponsible generosity?</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifySigned_RovingClans">Truly, your leadership is an example to us all! Auriga profits from your presence.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifyAcknowledged_RovingClans">We blush at the profusion of your compliments. Partners like you are as precious as they are rare.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningSigned_RovingClans">We once felt you were worth your weight in gold; lately we compare you to much baser metals. Do keep that in mind.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningAcknowledged_RovingClans">Bah. Your insults are as pathetic as your profit reports.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RovingClans">Your #F3EAD8#peaceful#REVERT# behavior pleases us greatly. Trade, markets, and travel thrive; what's good for business is good for us all!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RovingClans">We trade the same goods and fight a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT# - you have earned our trust and confidence!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RovingClans">A #F3EAD8#common friend#REVERT# indicates mutual interests, thus mutual opportunities. Our common future looks very promising!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RovingClans">#F3EAD8#Common allies#REVERT#! We shall have a great celebration, then discuss our glorious future the next morning. Or perhaps the next afternoon...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RovingClans">There is plenty of room on Auriga, and #F3EAD8#common frontiers#REVERT# promote common trade. Welcome, neighbor!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RovingClans">This #F3EAD8#war fatigue#REVERT# begins to annoy - and impoverish - us. I think we can think of better things to do with our wealth!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetPositive_Occurrence1_RovingClans">People can end up at war for foolish reasons; let us forget our #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT# and look to future gains.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RovingClans">There is no excuse for such destruction. Think of the investors! #F3EAD8#Aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# is not appreciated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RovingClans">We have #F3EAD8#taken your city#REVERT#; its valuables are now ours. Might you be thinking that war is not the best solution?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RovingClans">You've #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT#! Perhaps before the balance sheet takes further damage we should consider other options together.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RovingClans">Your military investments seem to have paid off well; #F3EAD8#your great military power#REVERT# echoes our own economic strength.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RovingClans">Regardless of where and how R√†d√†t keeps the tally of the worth of empires, remember that ours is currently the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RovingClans">Auriga trembles with your footsteps. Truly, a leader of your stature might gain wealth beyond measure ruling the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RovingClans">Your #F3EAD8#troops in our territory#REVERT# have come to visit! How congenial. We do hope there will be no unnecessary fees due to incidental damages.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RovingClans">Trade prospers when peace prospers; we appreciate your commitment to #F3EAD8#peaceful#REVERT# objectives.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RovingClans">We would rather come together via trade and commerce than a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT#, but friends made in war are better than none at all.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RovingClans">We share #F3EAD8#common friends#REVERT#; this may indicate common opportunities.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RovingClans">A #F3EAD8#common ally#REVERT# joining our alliance could be the start of closer ties and better prices.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RovingClans">Please note that you are encroaching on a #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT#, and this should not be a common occurrence.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RovingClans">All this cost, wasted time, and the exhaustion of #F3EAD8#war fatigue#REVERT#. Is there no more profitable way to spend your time?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNeutral_Occurrence1_RovingClans">A wise leader might be willing to forget the #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT#, and think of new fortunes to be made.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RovingClans">That #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# was unprofitable and disturbing. The markets and the clans don't like this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RovingClans">#F3EAD8#Taking your city#REVERT# was just part of the deal. Things happen - in war like in business.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RovingClans">You have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT#, and that is bad for business. We don't like things that are bad for business.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RovingClans">It is good to recall, from time to time, that our power is not only economic; strategies of war are not unfamiliar and we are the #F3EAD8#greatest military power#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RovingClans">You may impose your outcome with #F3EAD8#your great military power#REVERT#, but we are not weak and the eyes and ears of the clans are everywhere.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RovingClans">The scales seem to balance in our favor no matter how you look at them. This is not a threat, merely an observation from the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RovingClans">We are impressed by the way you run yours, the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#. We will watch, consider, and learn.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RovingClans">We noticed your #F3EAD8#troops moving into our territory#REVERT#, and request that they continue moving until they have departed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RovingClans">We see that you are acting #F3EAD8#peacefully#REVERT#, but our memories are as long as our ledgers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RovingClans">You're doing better with your choice of a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT#. But we have still not zeroed the balance from back when we were one.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RovingClans">I see we now have a #F3EAD8#common friend#REVERT#. New friends are necessary, when you continue to mistreat old ones.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RovingClans">So we have a #F3EAD8#common ally#REVERT#? Perhaps you bring them close to better position the knife in their back.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RovingClans">We have a #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT#, and it is as worrying as hearing that you were in the vault next to us at the bank...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RovingClans">We are tired, and our savings all but spent. But in spite of #F3EAD8#war fatigue#REVERT# we will not concede to you unless the gods themselves desert us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNegative_Occurrence1_RovingClans">We recall our #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT# with all the joy of a market crash, and recall you as the cause of a lot of unnecessary poverty.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RovingClans">This #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# is nearly an act of war! Look to your borders. And your purses...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RovingClans">You will note that we have #F3EAD8#taken your city#REVERT#; please also note that we found that act both enjoyable and profitable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RovingClans">You have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT#, but we are used to long and arduous roads. Recovering it is simply one more.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RovingClans">Your #F3EAD8#weak military#REVERT# is like a beggar on the street - pathetic and unworthy of concern.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceDeclarationAcknowledged_MadFairies">You end this #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# with a #F3EAD8#forced#REVERT# #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT#? Inelegant. Like driving an arrow into a target by hand.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToColdWarSigned_MadFairies">In this atmosphere #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# cannot take root. The chill of #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# is more suitable.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToWarAcknowledged_MadFairies">We find the winter of a #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# unpleasant. We are eager to see how the heat of #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# suits us!</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToWarSigned_MadFairies">This #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# faded like snow in the sun; it is #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# that will replace it!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToWarAcknowledged_MadFairies">If you are mad enough to betray an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# and start a #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#, it is better to fight than befriend you!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceProposed_MadFairies">Little growth occurs in a state of #F3EAD8#Cold war#REVERT#. Perhaps you would consider #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# between us?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceSigned_MadFairies">Our empires may grow tall and strong in a time of #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceRefused_MadFairies">#F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT#? No, we do not see how that would serve Gaia.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceProposed_MadFairies">Our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# did not bear the fruit we had hoped; let us return to simple #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceSigned_MadFairies">So we chop and burn our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#, and grow #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# from the ashes? So be it.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceDeclarationSigned_MadFairies">We find #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# unpleasant; we insist on a status of #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceDeclarationAcknowledged_MadFairies">#F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT# grows poorly on where it is not welcome. We shall see.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceSigned_MadFairies">It is good; your proposal for an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# fell on welcoming soil.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceRefused_MadFairies">An #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# with you could only bear bitter fruit; we do not accept it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceProposed_MadFairies">From #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# can grow great things; we propose an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceSigned_MadFairies">Let us grow together in this #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#; may Gaia bless our undertaking!</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceDeclarationSigned_MadFairies">The needs of our people give you no choice; we move from #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#
 to #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged_MadFairies">What? Being pulled from #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# to an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# is like ripping an oak from an acorn.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationSigned_MadFairies">It is a small step made in good faith; it is but a bowshot from #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#
 to #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged_MadFairies">We are receiving an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# like rainfall; it comes whether you wish it or not.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealRefused_MadFairies">We do #F3EAD8#not accept#REVERT# your offer any more than a deer accepts wolves.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSigned_MadFairies">For the good of Gaia we must #F3EAD8#declare#REVERT# this new policy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationAcknowledged_MadFairies">You force your decision upon us; like a change in the weather we can only #F3EAD8#accept#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifySigned_MadFairies">Under your wise guidance, Auriga flourishes and the future seems more hopeful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifyAcknowledged_MadFairies">We thank you for your kind words; may we build a better future together.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningSigned_MadFairies">Sadly we do not see monuments being raised in your honor; we would not even raise a cup to you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningAcknowledged_MadFairies">Was that some sort of warning, or merely hot air blowing through dead leaves?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_MadFairies">Your #F3EAD8#peaceful#REVERT# demeanor gives all Auriga hope for a brighter destiny.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_MadFairies">We see that we have #F3EAD8#common enemies#REVERT#; this reassures us that you have good intentions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_MadFairies">Your friends appear to be the same as our friends. #F3EAD8#Common friends#REVERT# are a sign that suggests more trust and less conflict.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_MadFairies">#F3EAD8#Common allies#REVERT# and a common alliance. In forest and town we share things of importance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_MadFairies">We share a #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT#; this is a good thing as long as land and resources are not ruined or squandered.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_MadFairies">The forests and plains weep after this long and destructive war. #F3EAD8#War fatigue#REVERT# eats our very bones; it has gone on long enough.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetPositive_Occurrence1_MadFairies">Forests bud anew each spring. In much the same way, we are willing to forget the #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT# and start again.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_MadFairies">This #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# is not the act of a stable character. We hope it does not happen twice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_MadFairies">Our arrows have #F3EAD8#taken your city#REVERT#; perhaps now you see that it is in your interest to end this war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_MadFairies">You have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT# and gotten what you wanted. Put aside destruction, and think of building anew.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_MadFairies">We note your armies and #F3EAD8#your great military power#REVERT#; they are the mighty trees of a great forest.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_MadFairies">We have a vision of Auriga as a great forest of cities and culture. As it stands, we are the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#, and yours is in need of help.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_MadFairies">Yours, the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#, stands like a forest spirit across Auriga; we are awed by your success.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_MadFairies">Your #F3EAD8#troops are in our territory#REVERT#. We trust they are here to learn of nature, and nothing else.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_MadFairies">Your calm and #F3EAD8#peaceful#REVERT# behavior has been noticed. We hope you continue it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_MadFairies">We share a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT#. That does not make us fast friends, but perhaps it makes us less likely to go to war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_MadFairies">We have #F3EAD8#common friends#REVERT#; we therefore hope that relations will not become strained.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_MadFairies">We have a #F3EAD8#common ally#REVERT# now joining us; it is a good day for peace on Auriga.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_MadFairies">We now share a #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT#, and hope that you will be a good neighbor on your side of it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_MadFairies">A great deal of damage has been done in the course of this war; you should not be proud of this achievement and the effects of #F3EAD8#war fatigue#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNeutral_Occurrence1_MadFairies">The #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT# occurred for outdated reasons. Seasons have remade the world since then; perhaps we should also reconsider.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_MadFairies">We do not take depredations lightly. #F3EAD8#Aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# is still an attack on our empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_MadFairies">#F3EAD8#Taking your city#REVERT# was as an act and spoil of war; accept your loss and consider your next moves carefully.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_MadFairies">You have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT# and despoiled a green and growing thing. We will not forget this act of brutality.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_MadFairies">We hold the #F3EAD8#greatest military power#REVERT#; gauge your actions carefully lest we fall upon you like a hurricane.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_MadFairies">We see #F3EAD8#your great military power#REVERT#. But before you do anything foolish remember that the forests are dark, and our arrows sharp.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_MadFairies">Your empire wanes in many ways. It would be wise, gardener, to tend to your plants the way our #F3EAD8#great empire#REVERT# does.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_MadFairies">We note that you rule the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#, but are still content in our towers and forests.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_MadFairies">Your #F3EAD8#troops in our territory#REVERT# appear to be poorly versed in map reading. Please let them know that they have wandered into our territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_MadFairies">We see you acting in a #F3EAD8#peaceful#REVERT# way, but recent actions still make us view you like a viper in the grass.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_MadFairies">We have a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT#. This is true. But our shared past still makes it impossible to trust you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_MadFairies">We have a #F3EAD8#common friend#REVERT#, and wonder if we should warn them about you. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_MadFairies">So we have a #F3EAD8#common ally#REVERT#? We note that wolves and deer that share the same forest don't suddenly become friends.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_MadFairies">With this expansion we have a #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT#? We see your eagerness to claim territory, and wonder if ours is next.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_MadFairies">The earth itself is exhausted by this war. We will fight, however, until the rocks tire as well. #F3EAD8#War fatigue#REVERT# will not bring us low.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNegative_Occurrence1_MadFairies">We can never forgive the destruction wrought by you in the #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT#; Gaia herself would disown us if we did.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_MadFairies">Enough is enough! You have so little honor that even cold war is a mockery. Your #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# will be punished.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_MadFairies">We have just #F3EAD8#taken your city#REVERT#; it will take weeks to once more grow its gardens and remove the stink of your vile empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_MadFairies">The final winter will come and cover Auriga in a white veil before we forget that you have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_MadFairies">Your #F3EAD8#weak military#REVERT# is as dangerous as a decorative plant. Sadly, it is uglier and smells worse.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_MadFairies">#F3EAD8#Your great military power#REVERT# is like a drunken bear; dangerous but laughable and worthy of pity.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_MadFairies">Call off your dogs that trespass on our lands, or we will have them whipped.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceProposed_Necrophages">We thank you for feeding the hive, but we have had our fill and propose a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceSigned_Necrophages">A #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# serves the hive.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceRefused_Necrophages">Your #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# is refused. #F3EAD8#War#REVERT# is our natural state.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceDeclarationSigned_Necrophages">The hive wishes a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT#. You will not go against the hive.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceDeclarationAcknowledged_Necrophages">You #F3EAD8#force#REVERT# a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# on the hive? It will not reduce our hunger.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToColdWarSigned_Necrophages">The hive hates #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#. A #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# is far better.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToColdWarAcknowledged_Necrophages">We do not mind a #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#, even if it is forced upon us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToColdWarSigned_Necrophages">An #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# with other species is not natural; we prefer to be at #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToColdWarAcknowledged_Necrophages">We go from an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# to a #F3EAD8#forced#REVERT# #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#. Thank you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceToWarSigned_Necrophages">A #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# is a useless thing. Back to happy #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceToWarAcknowledged_Necrophages">We go from #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# to #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#? The hive extends its gratitude.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToWarSigned_Necrophages">#F3EAD8#Cold war#REVERT# is never as good as true #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToWarAcknowledged_Necrophages">We do not see going from #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# to #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# as a particular problem.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToWarSigned_Necrophages">#F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT# delayed your fate for a time, but now we go to #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToWarAcknowledged_Necrophages">The hive is always ready for #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToWarSigned_Necrophages">You were poor #F3EAD8#allies#REVERT#. We look forward to treating you as you deserve in #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToWarAcknowledged_Necrophages">How mad can you be to leave an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# with the hive to go to #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#? It is our natural state.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceProposed_Necrophages">#F3EAD8#Cold war#REVERT# is useless - none of the benefits of war or of peace. Should we try #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# between us?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceSigned_Necrophages">Your offer of #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# is convenient. We accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceRefused_Necrophages">#F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT#? Perhaps you are unaware of who you are talking to. Or you are insane.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceProposed_Necrophages">An #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# is for fools. Simple #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# allows us to do we want.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceSigned_Necrophages">You desire to gut our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#? We are indifferent to your passions. #F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT# is fine.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceRefused_Necrophages">We prefer to keep a close eye on you in an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceAcknowledged_Necrophages">You break our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# to impose a #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#? You are strange. We do not trust you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceDeclarationSigned_Necrophages">Now we are at #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#. That is all. Please do not whine about it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceDeclarationAcknowledged_Necrophages">#F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT# does not suit us. But we have no choice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceProposed_Necrophages">We should form an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#. "Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer." Heh heh. Just kidding.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceSigned_Necrophages">We are willing to test an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceRefused_Necrophages">We can think of no sane reason to enter an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceProposed_Necrophages">We see great gains for the hive if we form an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceSigned_Necrophages">So, we are now in an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#. This may be interesting.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceRefused_Necrophages">An #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#? Never. Go hold hands with somebody else.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceDeclarationSigned_Necrophages">In fact you will #F3EAD8#join#REVERT# this #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#. Accept your fate.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged_Necrophages">From #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# to #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#? Perhaps this is what that "insanity" word means.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationSigned_Necrophages">#F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT# means neither enemies nor friends; we will now form #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# with you. You have no choice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged_Necrophages">You #F3EAD8#force#REVERT# the hive to do something it doesn't want to do? A strange way to start an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealProposed_Necrophages">We are making an offer. Consider it. Usually we just take what we want.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealAccepted_Necrophages">The hive can benefit. We #F3EAD8#accept#REVERT# your offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSigned_Necrophages">The hive can benefit. We #F3EAD8#accept#REVERT# your offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealRefused_Necrophages">As the hive has no wish to die, your deal is #F3EAD8#rejected#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSigned_Necrophages">The hive has decided what you will do, as you seem incapable yourself.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationAcknowledged_Necrophages">You force this on us? We may appear to be insects, but we do not crush so easily.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifySigned_Necrophages">For a species with such an unfortunate lack of limbs you show surprising skill.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifyAcknowledged_Necrophages">We understand that you give us a "compliment". You are weird.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningSigned_Necrophages">There are other nations besides the Endless that are worthy of our contempt; we are curious why you try so hard to be added to the list.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningAcknowledged_Necrophages">If you wish to be added to the list of the hive's enemies we will not stop you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Necrophages">Your #F3EAD8#peaceful#REVERT# actions are appreciated, as they further our own ambitions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Necrophages">You fight a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT#; we are now aware of your good sense. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Necrophages">We note that we have a #F3EAD8#common friend#REVERT#. These are few, and have more than just nutritional value.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Necrophages">We share #F3EAD8#common allies#REVERT#; it is less likely then that we will feed on the bodies of your dead.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Necrophages">You undertake an expansion next to us. Welcome to a #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT#, but beware that it can be dangerous.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Necrophages">Even the hive can feel #F3EAD8#war fatigue#REVERT#, though we call it "daily life". Perhaps we should consider other ideas?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetPositive_Occurrence1_Necrophages">A lot happened between us in the #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT#. But those eggs have long since hatched, and a lot has changed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Necrophages">Think a moment before you commit random acts of #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#. There could be consequences.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Necrophages">Thank you for letting us #F3EAD8#take your city#REVERT#. It was delicious. Perhaps we should discuss the future?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Necrophages">You have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT# from the hive. We are not happy, but war has consequences. Let's talk about improving them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Necrophages">#F3EAD8#Your great military power#REVERT# is noted. The hive is rarely impressed; you should be honored.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Necrophages">The hive is the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT# on Auriga. But we will not laugh at your inferior position.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Necrophages">We see that you rule the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#, and wonder - for the first time - if we may learn something from an alien.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Necrophages">Your #F3EAD8#troops are in our territory#REVERT#. This is not desirable. However we are not hungry, and will let them leave unharmed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Necrophages">You seem to be a champion of #F3EAD8#peaceful#REVERT# behavior. Is this necessarily a good thing?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Necrophages">The hive shares a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT# with you. Life is full of surprises.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Necrophages">We have a #F3EAD8#common friend#REVERT#. This is not of great importance, other than that it puts you lower on the shopping list.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Necrophages">It is nice that we now share a #F3EAD8#common ally#REVERT#. Except that it's another source of nutrition that has escaped us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Necrophages">We have a #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT#. Please simplify our lives and stay on your side of it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Necrophages">The hive is not greatly affected by #F3EAD8#war fatigue#REVERT#. However, we can be persuaded to acknowledge it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNeutral_Occurrence1_Necrophages">Our #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT# left an unpleasant taste in our mouths. Literally. Yet we will do it again if we must.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Necrophages">Please note that #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# is still aggression, and may be dealt with that way.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Necrophages">You have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT#. You will be unsurprised to hear that this does not please the hive.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Necrophages">The armies of the hive are the #F3EAD8#greatest military power#REVERT#; keep that in mind when planning your future.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Necrophages">The hive sees #F3EAD8#your great military power#REVERT#. We do not fear you, but feel no need to prove our strength.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Necrophages">Your empire lags behind ours in almost every conceivable way. Does it make you sad that you are so far behind the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Necrophages">We see that you are the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#. But these things are temporary, and the hive cares only for the final end.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Necrophages">Your #F3EAD8#troops in our territory#REVERT# should perhaps receive orders to go home. If they ever want to see it again.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Necrophages">So we have a #F3EAD8#common ally#REVERT#! Don't expect celebrations, or even patience.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Necrophages">Your expansion gives us a common frontier. Think of it as a line in the dirt: One side, your city; other side, your death.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Necrophages">Your acts of #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# will no longer be tolerated. The hive begins to buzz.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Necrophages">#F3EAD8#Taking your city#REVERT# provided us with wonderful resources and few excellent banquets. We look forward to the next one.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToColdWarSigned_Vaulters">It pained us to leave the halls, as it does to leave this #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#. But #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# better reflects your actions.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceSigned_Vaulters">We agree that this #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# would be better as a treaty of #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#. We must look to our own interests.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceRefused_Vaulters">We will not accept an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# with you; unlike materials join poorly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceProposed_Vaulters">Your actions while at #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# have been trustworthy; what say you to an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#?</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceRefused_Vaulters">We are uninterested in an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#; trust and understanding still lack.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceDeclarationSigned_Vaulters">For the common good we change this #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# to an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#. In time you will thank us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged_Vaulters">Going from #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# to a #F3EAD8#forced#REVERT# #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#? It's like having your teeth ripped out and replaced with better ones.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationSigned_Vaulters">We take the step from #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# to #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#; it is in the interest of the halls, and in your interest.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged_Vaulters">An involuntary #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#? We shall see if it is a mother lode or fool's gold...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealProposed_Vaulters">What do you say to our offer - it's fair for us both.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealAccepted_Vaulters">Agreed. We #F3EAD8#accept#REVERT# your offer in the name of our people.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSigned_Vaulters">In the name of our halls and hearths, we #F3EAD8#accept#REVERT# your offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealRefused_Vaulters">We do #F3EAD8#not accept#REVERT# this offer. If we did, our people would rightfully question our fitness to rule.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSigned_Vaulters">From time to time things only advance if you #F3EAD8#declare#REVERT# that they do so. Like now.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationAcknowledged_Vaulters">We are forced to #F3EAD8#accept#REVERT# your offer; there will be grumbling about this around the fires.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifySigned_Vaulters">The stones and bones of our people appreciate your talent and what you have achieved with it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifyAcknowledged_Vaulters">Your acknowledgement of quality work does you credit; your good taste is noted and appreciated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningSigned_Vaulters">There is a long list of character traits that we appreciate. You seem to lack them all.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningAcknowledged_Vaulters">What was that noise? We are used to swatting insects, not chatting with them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Vaulters">You do a good job keeping your problems to yourself and your armies on a short leash. #F3EAD8#Peaceful#REVERT# actions are much appreciated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Vaulters">You choose your enemies wisely. Very wisely, for we now have a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT#, and perhaps a common cause.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Vaulters">We have a #F3EAD8#common friend#REVERT#. This is good; it greatly reduces the chances that we'll be swinging hammers at each other.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Vaulters">As we share #F3EAD8#common allies#REVERT# and friends, sharing a tale and an adventure can't be far behind.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Vaulters">Your new region borders a #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT#. For the moment we view it as having friends nearby, not enemies within bowshot.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Vaulters">Supplies, money, and tempers are as short as this war has been long. #F3EAD8#War fatigue#REVERT# makes us want to find other options.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetPositive_Occurrence1_Vaulters">Much has been mined since our #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT#; it is perhaps time to look to the future and not dwell on past injuries.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Vaulters">This surprise #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# is not the work of a trustworthy leader. Think of the consequences.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Vaulters">Our marines have #F3EAD8#taken your city#REVERT#; perhaps now you see that it is in your interest to end this war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Vaulters">You have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT# and gotten what you wanted. We're willing to talk; there are other things we could be doing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Vaulters">It is not easy to impress us, but we have to say that #F3EAD8#your great military power#REVERT# has done the job.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Vaulters">We see ours, the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#, leading Auriga in many ways. Yours seems to be more of a follower.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Vaulters">In the face of your power and success, we cannot help but feel awed and unimpressive before the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Vaulters">Some of your #F3EAD8#troops are in our territory#REVERT#. If they are paying a friendly visit, that is acceptable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Vaulters">It is good to have #F3EAD8#peaceful#REVERT# relations. See that things stay that way.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Vaulters">We have been given a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT# to fight, which is better than fighting each other.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Vaulters">#F3EAD8#Common friends#REVERT# are a good thing; we may be less likely to end up across battle lines.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Vaulters">With a #F3EAD8#common ally#REVERT# in the alliance it is likely that our relations will remain stable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Vaulters">Borders are convenient things. Now that we share a #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT#, we can keep an eye on each other.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Vaulters">Lives, material, and valuables have been lost or destroyed. #F3EAD8#War fatigue#REVERT# from your foolishness eats at us all.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNeutral_Occurrence1_Vaulters">We try not to bear grudges for the #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT#, and recommend you try to do the same. Though it isn't easy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Vaulters">Careful of whose toes you tread on with your cute little #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#. Our toes are inside boots that kick.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Vaulters">We have #F3EAD8#taken your city#REVERT# and might just keep it. We're learning to enjoy life up on the surface.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Vaulters">Good citizens labor like slaves in the city you captured. Our thoughts go out to them, and to what we should do next...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Vaulters">Our armies are supreme upon Auriga. You would do well to remember that within our vaults lie the arms of the #F3EAD8#greatest military power#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Vaulters">We do not have the habit of groveling, and won't do it because of #F3EAD8#your great military power#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Vaulters">Whatever your empire is forged of, the material is weak. You should learn what you can from us, the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Vaulters">You appear to rule well. Yet in spite of the strength of yours, the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#, we still manage to sleep at night.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Vaulters">We noticed you have #F3EAD8#troops in our territory#REVERT#. We can't help it, as the sound of marching feet makes us wary.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Vaulters">Were it not for our common history, your #F3EAD8#peaceful#REVERT# actions might almost lead us to trust you. Almost.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Vaulters">We must mine a great deal before work makes us forget your past actions. A #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT# does not change that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Vaulters">We have a new #F3EAD8#common friend#REVERT#! That is lovely. See that you don't treat them the way you treated us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Vaulters">How nice that we have a #F3EAD8#common ally#REVERT#. We will recommend they wear armor on their backs when dealing with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Vaulters">So a #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT# means you claim more land? Apparently your greed will only be limited by the will of others.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Vaulters">We are an old nation, and a strong one. This war has gone on long, but #F3EAD8#war fatigue#REVERT# or not we will see it through to your end.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNegative_Occurrence1_Vaulters">Your talent for destruction in the #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT# tells us that good relations with you are unlikely as long as you are alive.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Vaulters">Such an #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# clearly indicates a desire for more. Should you wish it, we are ready. Even eager.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Vaulters">We have #F3EAD8#taken your city#REVERT#. If we had known how shoddy your workmanship is, we might have left it to you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Vaulters">You have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT#, and your atrocities will not be forgiven. Our memories go all the way back to the stars.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Vaulters">We would call your #F3EAD8#weak military#REVERT# laughable, but there is really nothing funny about it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Vaulters">We care little for #F3EAD8#your great military power#REVERT# when we see the abominable behavior of the fool that leads it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Vaulters">Your brigands in armor invade my territory. This had better be an error that is rapidly fixed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceProposed_Drakkens">We dislike war in general and this one in particular - we propose a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceSigned_Drakkens">We are believers in diplomacy; we agree to end this #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# with a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceRefused_Drakkens">It is with heavy hearts that we are obliged to #F3EAD8#reject#REVERT# your offer of a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceDeclarationSigned_Drakkens">The Twelve have decided that this #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# shall end with a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT#. We do this for Auriga.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceDeclarationAcknowledged_Drakkens">You end this #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# with a #F3EAD8#forced#REVERT# #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT#. Though your goal is laudable, your methods are not.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToColdWarSigned_Drakkens">#F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT# is poorly appreciated by nations like yours. We return to a status of #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToColdWarAcknowledged_Drakkens">You change from a #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# to a #F3EAD8#forced cold war#REVERT#? This does not bode well for our mission or our planet.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToColdWarSigned_Drakkens">Your behavior has driven us from our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#; understand that we are now at #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToColdWarAcknowledged_Drakkens">We note you betray our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# and drive our peoples into #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#. We are not amused.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceToWarSigned_Drakkens">Your actions make a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# impossible. We have not choice but #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceToWarAcknowledged_Drakkens">So be it. If this #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# must give way to #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#, we shall not flinch!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToWarSigned_Drakkens">#F3EAD8#Cold war#REVERT# has not taught you a lesson. We fear that you can only learn the lessons of peace through #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToWarAcknowledged_Drakkens">You are too bloodthirsty to maintain a #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#? Then #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# it will be!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToWarSigned_Drakkens">Your disrespect for the principles of #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# leave us no option but to declare #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToWarAcknowledged_Drakkens">You betray our #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# with #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#? Have the ruins of the Endless taught you nothing?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToWarSigned_Drakkens">You have made a mockery of our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#; you drive us to declare #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# and put the future at risk.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToWarAcknowledged_Drakkens">We were #F3EAD8#allies#REVERT# until you betrayed us. So be it; we shall settle this in #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceProposed_Drakkens">#F3EAD8#Cold war#REVERT# does not advance our mission. What do you say to #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# between us?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceSigned_Drakkens">The Twelve agree to move from #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# in favor of your offer of #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceRefused_Drakkens">You have not earned the right to #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#; we remain at #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceProposed_Drakkens">We had great hopes for our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#, but fear that you cannot be trusted with more than a status of #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceSigned_Drakkens">Our mission would be better served by an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#. But we will accept mere #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# if we must.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceRefused_Drakkens">There is too much value in our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# to terminate it and move to #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceAcknowledged_Drakkens">Our greater mission is far better served by an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#. We are saddened that you prefer #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceDeclarationSigned_Drakkens">The future of Auriga is best served by being at #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#; please accept the inevitable calmly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceDeclarationAcknowledged_Drakkens">It is odd for us to prefer #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# to a status of #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#, but this time we must. Strangely, we see that our will is not our own.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceProposed_Drakkens">Far better than a #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#, let us face the troubled future as members of an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceSigned_Drakkens">This is a great and sudden change, yet the creation of an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# bodes well for our future.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceRefused_Drakkens">From #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# to #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# is perhaps better done in steps than in one great leap...</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceSigned_Drakkens">Great good could be done for our mission by creating an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#. We agree!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceRefused_Drakkens">#F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT# is better suited to our current relations; it is not time to speak of an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceDeclarationSigned_Drakkens">This #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# is a necessity; we apologize but you must #F3EAD8#join#REVERT# it!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged_Drakkens">From #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# to an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# is an enormous step! We accept it, but are dubious.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationSigned_Drakkens">#F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT# does not sufficiently advance our needs; you are now part of a great #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged_Drakkens">We are uneasy with one-sided declarations, but accept that we must #F3EAD8#join#REVERT# your #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealProposed_Drakkens">Our offer is magnanimous; it is in the interest of Auriga that you accept it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealAccepted_Drakkens">We #F3EAD8#accept#REVERT# your offer and look forward to a peaceful future.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSigned_Drakkens">We find this offer to be in harmony with our mission.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealRefused_Drakkens">We would fail in our duty if we were to do anything other than #F3EAD8#reject#REVERT# your offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSigned_Drakkens">We have an excellent idea for a new policy; we are sure you will come to appreciate it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationAcknowledged_Drakkens">We do not like to be forced into agreements; we acknowledge and #F3EAD8#accept#REVERT# it against our will.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifySigned_Drakkens">Leaders such as yourself give us great hope for the future of Auriga and the return to a better time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifyAcknowledged_Drakkens">You do not need to shower us with praise; it is our hope that Auriga herself will acknowledge our efforts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningSigned_Drakkens">It is our duty to find the good and the beautiful within all things. You make this task particularly difficult.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningAcknowledged_Drakkens">If you wish to threaten us, to show us your teeth, recall that diplomacy can be carried out by other means.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Drakkens">Your wisdom in facing adversity with calm strength is admirable. We rejoice that you are counted among the #F3EAD8#peaceful#REVERT# empires.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Drakkens">When war is necessary, it is better to be with us than against us. Your wisdom in choosing a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT# is appreciated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Drakkens">We have #F3EAD8#common friends#REVERT#, a rarity in these turbulent days. Your wisdom and discrimination are appreciated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Drakkens">We share #F3EAD8#common allies#REVERT#; once again rays of hope pierce the cloudy future of this troubled world.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Drakkens">With this #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT# we note your interest in growing your empire; as long as we remain peaceful neighbors we see no reason to take action.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Drakkens">War cannot be an end in itself, and this one has gone on far too long. #F3EAD8#War fatigue#REVERT# drains us; let us look to better things.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetPositive_Occurrence1_Drakkens">We do not forget the #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT#, but over time we understand the need to forgive, and move on.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Drakkens">We do not see a need to heat up this cold war; it is occasionally good to think before you commit an #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Drakkens">We have #F3EAD8#taken your city#REVERT#; it is the price of your warlike tendencies. Perhaps you should learn to control them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Drakkens">You have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT# that meant you no harm. Perhaps you should consider tempering your actions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Drakkens">We prefer putting our efforts into peace, but we cannot but acknowledge #F3EAD8#your great military power#REVERT# and your ability to wage war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Drakkens">While we rule the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT# it pleases us to see small, poor, unthreatening empires like yours. It assures us that Auriga will avoid conflict.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Drakkens">That you rule the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT# is incontestable. We hope that your spirit and heart are as worthy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Drakkens">We see that your #F3EAD8#troops in our territory#REVERT# pay us a visit. Exchange is one way to further the goals of peace; please see that they stay friendly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Drakkens">You are a dignified and #F3EAD8#peaceful#REVERT# leader. It is our hope that your wisdom be taken as an example by other nations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Drakkens">It is a sad irony that we, who prefer peace, are brought nearer to your people through war on a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Drakkens">Some trust may be built on the fact that we share #F3EAD8#common friends#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Drakkens">A #F3EAD8#common ally#REVERT# joins the alliance; one hopes that this is but the first in a long string of good tidings.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Drakkens">We see we share another #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT#; though we are a peaceful people we are still not entirely at ease with this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Drakkens">The #F3EAD8#war fatigue#REVERT# tires and angers us; we wonder when you will be wise enough to have the same reaction.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNeutral_Occurrence1_Drakkens">Wars occurred between us in the past, but we hope that we learned in the #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT# and are wiser today.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Drakkens">Your #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# is viewed as unprovoked and unnecessary. We are a people that take peace seriously.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Drakkens">It was necessary to #F3EAD8#take your city#REVERT#. Though we prefer to live in peace, we will act if the necessity arises again.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Drakkens">Citizens of our empire are now yours, as you have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT#. This is a regrettable consequence of an unnecessary conflict.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Drakkens">Though we prefer diplomacy as the solution to disagreements, you should remember that we are the #F3EAD8#greatest military power#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Drakkens">We note #F3EAD8#your great military power#REVERT#, and remind you that brute force served the Endless quite poorly. There are other ways.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Drakkens">We have the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT# on Auriga, both morally and practically. We do not state this to be aggressive, merely to assert the truth.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Drakkens">Your empire shows unexpected greatness in many ways. We are impressed, and observant, as we watch the actions of the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Drakkens">Your #F3EAD8#troops in our territory#REVERT# are not an act of war, though they may be considered an act of bad manners.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Drakkens">#F3EAD8#Peaceful#REVERT# actions are always appreciated, but our common history requires that we view them with a certain skepticism.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Drakkens">It is good that we have #F3EAD8#common enemies#REVERT#, but this is not enough for us to forget that your choice of enemies has not always been so wise.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Drakkens">It is good to have a #F3EAD8#common friend#REVERT#, to be at peace. It is sad that you have not tried so hard with our empire, and prefer to court others.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Drakkens">It would be so much better to have a #F3EAD8#common ally#REVERT# if we could trust you to not betray either - or both - of us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Drakkens">Would that our #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT# was a high wall, from the way you have been acting. We have no faith or trust in you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Drakkens">Our will to persevere is great in spite of the horrors of this war. #F3EAD8#War fatigue#REVERT# grips us, but we will not fail in our dedication.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNegative_Occurrence1_Drakkens">We are never fond of war, and memories of our #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT# are particularly awful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Drakkens">Your acts of #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# bring us close to the limit of our patience, and we are very unpleasant when angry.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Drakkens">Our loyal troops have #F3EAD8#taken your city#REVERT# in the name of Auriga. We are merely fulfilling our duty if we do it again.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Drakkens">Our empire will not fail in its duty to the citizens. You have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT# and grind them beneath your bloodthirsty heel.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Drakkens">Were we not dedicated to peace for all the planet, we would regard your #F3EAD8#weak military#REVERT# with contempt bordering on mirth.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Drakkens">Your ability to spill blood may be great, and #F3EAD8#your great military power#REVERT# may be dominant, but you are still an object of derision.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Drakkens">#F3EAD8#Troops are in our territory#REVERT#; we insist that they leave or our preference for peace may be sorely tested.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceProposed_Cultists">The Cult has other priorities - perhaps we should change this #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# to a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceSigned_Cultists">The Unspoken has other tasks; it is content to sign a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceRefused_Cultists">Your #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# is #F3EAD8#refused#REVERT#; our holy war will continue.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceDeclarationSigned_Cultists">The Unspoken wishes to have a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT#; we are merely obeying his wishes. As you will, too.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceDeclarationAcknowledged_Cultists">The Cult ends a holy #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# with an unholy #F3EAD8#forced#REVERT# #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT#. Grotesque.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToColdWarSigned_Cultists">This #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# does not serve the Eternal End; The Cult prefers a #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToColdWarAcknowledged_Cultists">You drive the Unspoken into #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#? Fools. It knows how cold war can be.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToColdWarSigned_Cultists">This #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# brings us no closer to the Eternal End. Let us try #F3EAD8#Cold war#REVERT# instead.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToColdWarAcknowledged_Cultists">Very well. The Queen has no need for a faithless #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#; you will have your #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceToWarSigned_Cultists">Our #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# is no more. Prepare for #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceToWarAcknowledged_Cultists">The #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# is over? The Cult is content; #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# will bring the end of the faithless that much more quickly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToWarSigned_Cultists">#F3EAD8#Cold war#REVERT# allows you too much foolishness; know that we are now #F3EAD8#at war#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToWarAcknowledged_Cultists">You end this #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# and declare #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#? The armies of the Unspoken are prepared.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToWarSigned_Cultists">Your abuse of the Cult's patience in this #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# treaty is over. Prepare for #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToWarAcknowledged_Cultists">The Queen knows and sees all; we are prepared for your #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToWarSigned_Cultists">You were disrespectful #F3EAD8#allies#REVERT#; the Cult insists on #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToWarAcknowledged_Cultists">You break our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#? Let the faithful ring their gongs of #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceProposed_Cultists">We have tasks to bring the Eternal End, and #F3EAD8#Cold war#REVERT# makes it difficult. The Queen requests #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# between us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceSigned_Cultists">The Cult also prefers a status of #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# between our peoples.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceRefused_Cultists">The Cult believes there will be no #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# with you, other than the Eternal one.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceProposed_Cultists">This #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# brings us no closer to the Eternal End; we suggest a status of #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceSigned_Cultists">You would destroy this #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#? It served us, but #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# is better than nothing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceRefused_Cultists">We do not agree. This #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# is key to our mission, and we will not abandon it for mere #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceAcknowledged_Cultists">You demote our relations from #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# to #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#? Strange, as are most acts of the faithless.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceDeclarationSigned_Cultists">The will of the Queen is better served if we are at #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#. If you have questions, we will ignore them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceDeclarationAcknowledged_Cultists">Our lack of trust in you made us prefer #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#, but if you #F3EAD8#force#REVERT# #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# on us the Cult will persevere.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceProposed_Cultists">Wondrous things can happen if we change from #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# to an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#. Will you join with the faithful?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceSigned_Cultists">It serves the Eternal End to join this #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceRefused_Cultists">Your offer of an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# reeks of opportunism; our #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# is preferred.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceProposed_Cultists">Beyond #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#, the Cult would have you in our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# as we struggle to purify Auriga.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceSigned_Cultists">The Queen is most content with your offer of an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceRefused_Cultists">News of this reached the Unspoken who trembled with rage; we reject your #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# to remain at #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceDeclarationSigned_Cultists">The needs of the Queen outweigh your petty preferences; you will #F3EAD8#join#REVERT# us in our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged_Cultists">The Unspoken seethes with rage at this #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# you #F3EAD8#force#REVERT# upon us!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationSigned_Cultists">The Queen thanks you for your interest in #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#, but would like to inform you that you are now in our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged_Cultists">It is not a religious conversion, this #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# of yours. Why do you #F3EAD8#force#REVERT# it upon us with such insistence?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealProposed_Cultists">The Cult has made a most generous offer, and is sure that you will want to accept it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealAccepted_Cultists">They have indicated that we should #F3EAD8#accept#REVERT# your offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSigned_Cultists">The Queen states that your offer is advantageous; there is nothing else to say.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealRefused_Cultists">Our faith and our leaders all indicate that this offer must be #F3EAD8#rejected#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSigned_Cultists">The Cult has taken a decision; you will see it is in your best interest.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationAcknowledged_Cultists">The Cult does not bow to outside demands, but we see that in this case we have little choice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifySigned_Cultists">We are impressed by your abilities; your only failure is attachment to old and corrupted gods.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifyAcknowledged_Cultists">Would that your kind words came from the Queen. But we also accept the adulation of lesser beings.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningSigned_Cultists">There are other nations besides the Endless that are worthy of our contempt; we are curious why you try so hard to be added to the list.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningAcknowledged_Cultists">Be assured that when the Eternal End comes, we will not forget your desire to be known as an adversary.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Cult also prospers when Auriga is #F3EAD8#peaceful#REVERT#; we congratulate your desire to further mutual goals.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Cultists">In choosing a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT# you seek to weaken the Cult's foes. It could bode well for our mutual future.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Cultists">We note your good relations with other factions. As we say: "The friend of a #F3EAD8#common friend#REVERT# may not necessarily be an enemy."</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Cultists">We share #F3EAD8#common allies#REVERT#; perhaps one day you will come to share our vision of the death of the Endless.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Cultists">Auriga seems as vast as our great purpose. Though it is not, we still welcome your presence on our #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Unspoken wonders if this war is truly worth continuing; #F3EAD8#war fatigue#REVERT# clouds its minds and it wishes to turn to other matters.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetPositive_Occurrence1_Cultists">We were at war some time ago; much has changed since the #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT#, and the Queen hates you far less.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Cultists">Cold war does not give the right to violence. Do not be so willing to anger the Queen with your #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Cultists">We have #F3EAD8#taken your city#REVERT#, and it soon shall be converted to our cause. Your policy of war should perhaps be revised.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Cultists">You have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT#, and brought the faithful low. Before you do more damage perhaps you should stop and consider.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Unspoken notes #F3EAD8#your great military power#REVERT#, and some of its minds are impressed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Cult rules the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT# of Auriga. Glory! May the Queen one day rise from her chamber!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Cultists">You succeed in so many ways at so many things, ruling the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#. Do you perhaps have as many minds as the Unspoken?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Cultists">We see your #F3EAD8#troops in our territory#REVERT# are not sure where the borders lie, and have ventured onto our land.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Cultists">With peace, the Cult can focus on useful tasks. Your #F3EAD8#peaceful#REVERT# behavior is most convenient.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Cult fights a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT# with you. Perhaps, once you see the worth of our armies, you might accept the way of our religion?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Queen is aware that we have #F3EAD8#common friends#REVERT#, and is less hungry for your destruction.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Cultists">With a #F3EAD8#common ally#REVERT# now in the alliance your demise is of less interest.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Cultists">We now share a #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT# thanks to your expansion. Beware that your greed does not bring the wrath of the Unspoken.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Cultists">The war distracts us from greater things. This foolishness has gone on too long, and #F3EAD8#war fatigue#REVERT# drains our resources.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNeutral_Occurrence1_Cultists">It is best to start anew by joining the Cult, but forgetting #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT# is another - if less interesting - option.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Cultists">Do you think that #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# are somehow invisible? The Queen sees all; there may be consequences.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Cultists">We have #F3EAD8#taken your city#REVERT#, but they are large and wasteful. One less is hardly a problem.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Cultists">Loyal followers of the Queen languish since your infidels have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT#. It is difficult to see a positive side of this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Cultists">Whatever risky endeavors other empires may undertake, remember that the armies of the Cult are the #F3EAD8#greatest military power#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Cult is realistic. #F3EAD8#Your great military power#REVERT# may be superior, but do not discount the zeal and commitment of the faithful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Queen knows that we have the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#, and notes that some of the villages we have converted are worth more than yours.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Cult notes you rule the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#, and considers what actions it might take to imitate your success.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Cult feels that the #F3EAD8#troops in our territory#REVERT# might do well to consider other places to visit. Rapidly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Cultists">It is good that you act #F3EAD8#peacefully#REVERT#. But a few gestures do not erase the Cult's memory of old wounds and blasphemies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Cultists">Though we now share a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT#, the Queen remembers well the time when you were not so discerning in your conflicts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Cult recognizes your ability to make a new #F3EAD8#common friend#REVERT#. Unlike the Queen, you seem to forget old ones.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Cultists">So we have a #F3EAD8#common ally#REVERT#! The Cult is pleased. As soon as we trust you not to stab us we will turn to greet them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Cultists">You continue to grab territory, and the Cult continues to watch. But we may soon have to take more decisive actions along our #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Cultists">This grim war bleeds us dry. But as long as the Queen wills that we fight, #F3EAD8#war fatigue#REVERT# will not discourage us!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNegative_Occurrence1_Cultists">Remembering our #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT#, the Cult cannot see a time when it would view you with trust.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Cult sees your #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#, and the Unspoken begins to hate you. It is a good idea to be worried.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Cult has #F3EAD8#taken your city#REVERT# and will soon be turning it into more useful resources. We thank you for this donation, and look forward to the next.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Cultists">You have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT#. The Unspoken will have you paying for the lives of his followers in unspeakable agony.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Queen and the Unspoken respect strength; it is for this reason that they view your #F3EAD8#weak military#REVERT# with utter contempt.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Cult notes #F3EAD8#your great military power#REVERT#, but your complete lack of integrity makes you unworthy of trust or respect.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Cult notes the presence of your #F3EAD8#troops in our holy territory#REVERT#; they are not welcome and will not be tolerated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceProposed_Mezari">Had enough #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#? We're willing to consider a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceSigned_Mezari">We're tired of #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# - for the moment. A #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# is fine.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceRefused_Mezari">This #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# is an insult!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceDeclarationSigned_Mezari">We do not ask a gem what shape it wants to take; we cut it. And we do not ask you whether or not you want this #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceDeclarationAcknowledged_Mezari">#F3EAD8#War#REVERT# is not something we seek, but to impose a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# is strange indeed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToColdWarSigned_Mezari">You're not worthy of #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#. #F3EAD8#Cold war#REVERT# is more like it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToColdWarAcknowledged_Mezari">So you #F3EAD8#force#REVERT# us into #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#? Beware that it doesn't get warmer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToColdWarSigned_Mezari">It pained us to leave the halls, as it does to leave this #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#. But #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# better reflects your actions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToColdWarAcknowledged_Mezari">We move from #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# to #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#, always prepared for the worst.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceToWarSigned_Mezari">You could not be trusted to keep a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT#. It is time to go to #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceToWarAcknowledged_Mezari">The #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# was as laughable as your honor. Prepare for #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToWarSigned_Mezari">#F3EAD8#Cold war#REVERT# does not seem to limit your ambitions. If that is what it takes, we propose #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToWarAcknowledged_Mezari">If #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# does not limit your ambitions, then #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# it will be!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToWarSigned_Mezari">This #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# treaty is an embarrassment. Prepare for #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToWarAcknowledged_Mezari">We are unafraid to drop the tools of #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# and hone the weapons of #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToWarSigned_Mezari">You were treacherous #F3EAD8#allies#REVERT#; the price of that will be #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# in your homes and halls!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToWarAcknowledged_Mezari">We do not forget friends in an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#; you will learn that we do not forget enemies in #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# either.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceProposed_Mezari">Our #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# benefits no one. Let us forge instead a healthy #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceSigned_Mezari">We look forward to carving our future in #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceRefused_Mezari">Our stones and bones tell us that you cannot be trusted with #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceProposed_Mezari">This #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# is a sham; #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# is what your empire merits.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceSigned_Mezari">We agree that this #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# would be better as a treaty of #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#. We must look to our own interests.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceRefused_Mezari">The foundations of our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# are solid; we would maintain it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceAcknowledged_Mezari">We do not understand why you replace our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# with a treaty of #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#. It makes us suspicious.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceDeclarationSigned_Mezari">We are too constrained by this #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#. It's time we were at #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceDeclarationAcknowledged_Mezari">It seems odd to us to be #F3EAD8#forced#REVERT# into #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#, but we see there is little choice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceProposed_Mezari">What do you say to an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#, that we dig in together to face common enemies in this dying world?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceSigned_Mezari">We agree to face the future shoulder-to-shoulder in an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceRefused_Mezari">We will not accept an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# with you; unlike materials join poorly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceProposed_Mezari">Your actions while at #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# have been trustworthy; what say you to an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceSigned_Mezari">Allies and trusted friends are few; we are content to forge this #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceRefused_Mezari">We are uninterested in an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#; trust and understanding still lack.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceDeclarationSigned_Mezari">For the common good we change this #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# to an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#. In time you will thank us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged_Mezari">Going from #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# to a #F3EAD8#forced#REVERT# #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#? It's like having your teeth ripped out and replaced with better ones.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationSigned_Mezari">We take the step from #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#
 to #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#; it is in the interest of the halls, and in your interest.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged_Mezari">An involuntary #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#? We shall see if it is a mother lode or fool's gold...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealProposed_Mezari">What do you say to our offer - it's fair for us both.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealAccepted_Mezari">Agreed. We #F3EAD8#accept#REVERT# your offer in the name of our people.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSigned_Mezari">In the name of our halls and hearths, we #F3EAD8#accept#REVERT# your offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealRefused_Mezari">We do #F3EAD8#not accept#REVERT# this offer. If we did, our people would rightfully question our fitness to rule.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSigned_Mezari">From time to time things only advance if you #F3EAD8#declare#REVERT# that they do so. Like now.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationAcknowledged_Mezari">We are forced to #F3EAD8#accept#REVERT# your offer; there will be grumbling about this around the fires.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifySigned_Mezari">The stones and bones of our people appreciate your talent and what you have achieved with it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifyAcknowledged_Mezari">Your acknowledgement of quality work does you credit; your good taste is noted and appreciated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningSigned_Mezari">There is a long list of character traits that we appreciate. You seem to lack them all.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningAcknowledged_Mezari">What was that noise? We are used to swatting insects, not chatting with them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mezari">You do a good job keeping your problems to yourself and your armies on a short leash. #F3EAD8#Peaceful#REVERT# actions are much appreciated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mezari">You choose your enemies wisely. Very wisely, for we now have a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT#, and perhaps a common cause.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mezari">We have a #F3EAD8#common friend#REVERT#. This is good; it greatly reduces the chances that we'll be swinging hammers at each other.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mezari">As we share #F3EAD8#common allies#REVERT# and friends, sharing a tale and an adventure can't be far behind.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mezari">Your new region borders a #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT#. For the moment we view it as having friends nearby, not enemies within bowshot.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mezari">Supplies, money, and tempers are as short as this war has been long. #F3EAD8#War fatigue#REVERT# makes us want to find other options.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetPositive_Occurrence1_Mezari">Much has been mined since our #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT#; it is perhaps time to look to the future and not dwell on past injuries.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mezari">This surprise #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# is not the work of a trustworthy leader. Think of the consequences.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mezari">Our marines have #F3EAD8#taken your city#REVERT#; perhaps now you see that it is in your interest to end this war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mezari">You have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT# and gotten what you wanted. We're willing to talk; there are other things we could be doing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mezari">It is not easy to impress us, but we have to say that #F3EAD8#your great military power#REVERT# has done the job.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mezari">We see ours, the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#, leading Auriga in many ways. Yours seems to be more of a follower.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mezari">In the face of your power and success, we cannot help but feel awed and unimpressive before the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mezari">Some of your #F3EAD8#troops are in our territory#REVERT#. If they are paying a friendly visit, that is acceptable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mezari">It is good to have #F3EAD8#peaceful#REVERT# relations. See that things stay that way.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mezari">We have been given a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT# to fight, which is better than fighting each other.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mezari">#F3EAD8#Common friends#REVERT# are a good thing; we may be less likely to end up across battle lines.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mezari">With a #F3EAD8#common ally#REVERT# in the alliance it is likely that our relations will remain stable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mezari">Borders are convenient things. Now that we share a #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT#, we can keep an eye on each other.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mezari">Lives, material, and valuables have been lost or destroyed. #F3EAD8#War fatigue#REVERT# from your foolishness eats at us all.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNeutral_Occurrence1_Mezari">We try not to bear grudges for the #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT#, and recommend you try to do the same. Though it isn't easy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mezari">Careful of whose toes you tread on with your cute little #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#. Our toes are inside boots that kick.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mezari">We have #F3EAD8#taken your city#REVERT# and might just keep it. We're learning to enjoy life up on the surface.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mezari">Good citizens labor like slaves in the city you captured. Our thoughts go out to them, and to what we should do next...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mezari">Our armies are supreme upon Auriga. You would do well to remember that within our vaults lie the arms of the #F3EAD8#greatest military power#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mezari">We do not have the habit of groveling, and won't do it because of #F3EAD8#your great military power#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mezari">Whatever your empire is forged of, the material is weak. You should learn what you can from us, the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mezari">You appear to rule well. Yet in spite of the strength of yours, the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#, we still manage to sleep at night.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mezari">We noticed you have #F3EAD8#troops in our territory#REVERT#. We can't help it, as the sound of marching feet makes us wary.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mezari">Were it not for our common history, your #F3EAD8#peaceful#REVERT# actions might almost lead us to trust you. Almost.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mezari">We must mine a great deal before work makes us forget your past actions. A #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT# does not change that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mezari">We have a new #F3EAD8#common friend#REVERT#! That is lovely. See that you don't treat them the way you treated us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mezari">How nice that we have a #F3EAD8#common ally#REVERT#. We will recommend they wear armor on their backs when dealing with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mezari">So a #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT# means you claim more land? Apparently your greed will only be limited by the will of others.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mezari">We are an old nation, and a strong one. This war has gone on long, but #F3EAD8#war fatigue#REVERT# or not we will see it through to your end.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNegative_Occurrence1_Mezari">Your talent for destruction in the #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT# tells us that good relations with you are unlikely as long as you are alive.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mezari">Such an #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# during #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# clearly indicates a desire for more. Should you wish it, we are ready. Even eager.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mezari">We have #F3EAD8#taken your city#REVERT#. If we had known how shoddy your workmanship is, we might have left it to you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mezari">You have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT#, and your atrocities will not be forgiven. Our memories go all the way back to the stars.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mezari">We would call your #F3EAD8#weak military#REVERT# laughable, but there is really nothing funny about it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mezari">We care little for #F3EAD8#your great military power#REVERT# when we see the abominable behavior of the fool that leads it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mezari">Your brigands in armor invade my territory. This had better be an error that is rapidly fixed.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuestCoop#0003Description">There is a strange failure in the use of luxuries. Their cost has skyrocketed; they seem to have lost their effects on the populace who begin to show indifference - or ignorance - of their wondrous mysteries and powers. The most wondrous things on the planet are simply being taken for granted!
 
The best offense is excess; let all the factions trigger Lucury Resource Boosters and bathe the planet in their abundance. Then the people will wake up to the glorious world in which they live!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuestCoop#0003Objective">Luxury resource costs have skyrocketed as the populace becomes jaded and indifferent. We must work together to shake them out of this lassitude.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuestCoop#0004Description">Something is eating away at Auriga - literally. Reports have come in from many empires that the quality of metals has drastically decreased; it has become very expensive to forge or craft new items.

Rumor and science both point to ruins as the cause, as apparently some ancient magic has been slowly eating away at Strategic Resources. If you are to stop this effect, you must interrupt the cycle by delivering these arcane metals to the ruins in order to overload whatever magical agent is behind the curse. All the empires of Auriga have an interest in putting an end to this phenomenon!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuestCoop#0004Objective">Metals are rusting and weakening at an alarming rate! The empires of Auriga must attack the problem at ruins, where some ancient magic is leeching Strategic Resources.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuestCompet#0003Description">Auriga is alive; perhaps in ways that no one truly understands. An ancient manifestation known as a Guardian has come to life, springing from the bowels of the planet itself and roaming one of the regions.
 
If you wish to understand its origins and mysteries - and perhaps even master its creation - you must hurry to that region and be the first to defeat it. Do not take the task lightly, however.

Against their will they were forged into a tight society of violent and distrustful survivors, having spent the final years of the cataclysm alone on the surface of Auriga.

From cave systems to cliffside perches to dense forests, Forgotten design is focused on the twin pillars of defence and concealment. Therefore, among the trade guilds of the Forgotten, the Architects' Guild is considered one of the most vital. As a skilled member of this guild, for Gula Yawa, unfortunately, this also brought a great deal of personal friction. When an untouched Dust-infused ruin was discovered in the Amber Plains, the Sable Consecrate made it a priority to found a Forgotten settlement on the site. Despite voicing deep reservations about the endeavour on account of the vulnerable nature of the location, Gula was pressed into overseeing the construction of the settlement. Less than six moons after a hundred or so Forgotten established themselves in the outpost, all of Gula's worst fears came to pass when the settlement was slaughtered in a Necrophage attack.

Poisoning. Disembowelling. Her trademark, however, became a specialized form of decapitation, whereby the most slender thread of razor wire would be used to slice through a target's neck in one clean swipe. She especially delighted in setting such wires as traps in her mark's bed chambers, bathhouses, or private gardens. During her twenty years of service carrying out the orders of the Divinities' Masters, she eliminated exactly fifty enemies of the Forgotten. Upon receiving orders of her fifty-first mark, however, she balked. The target in question, a female Wild Walker clan dekari, happened to be the gentlest, most compassionate person she'd ever met, and not incidentally, also her lover.

During a sabbatical year in which she roamed Auriga living a nomadic life, however, her deepest held beliefs about her own race transformed completely.

Initially, the Clans' decadent lifestyle and worship of wealth disgusted Napog; in her letters back to her masters she would recount with great distaste all that she witnessed. Somewhere along the line, however, she developed a taste for the lavish trappings of life among the upper echelons of Clan society.

With no other youngsters close to his own age, Dabou found solace in the roost of skya owl-hawks who occupied the same wintry landscape. By eight he was able to coax one of them onto his arm, and by the time he'd seen twelve winters he could command his skya to attack the older youths who had mercilessly mocked him through his earlier years. As Dabuo grew his skya became his great strength; this was fortunate as he never found acceptance in his small community - especially after revealing that he'd always felt female inside. During a spell in the Forgotten capital as a mercenary with unusual skills Dabuo found some tolerance, but she now roams Auriga seeking a place where she will feel at home.</LocalizationPair>

At night, however, when the forge dimmed and the heat was less intense, Efalo had the run of the place. Because of these unusual conditions, she was forced to approach the blacksmith's art in an unusual way as she worked a blade or a piece of chain. Her pieces were slenderer, lighter - and yet still mocked for their fragility. Efalo had the last laugh, though, when she slipped into the season's Great Hunt and won the contest by stealing one of the Vaulter's most prized artefacts from deep inside their caverns. Accused of cheating, Efalo decided that some people other than her home clan might be more appreciative of her services...</LocalizationPair>

Many say she is even more dangerous than the Master Shadow they knew of yesteryear, but if you look closely you will see a recklessness in her eyes... perhaps, some might say, an emptiness.

Today that Ziema is perhaps gone forever, perhaps submerged so deep inside that she might as well have been vanquished. Beaten, burnt, flayed, her skin speaks every detail of her torture.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter1Description">My dreams are still haunted by the night we lost my friend, my rock, the previous leader of the Warfarers Divinity: Master Shadow Ziema Adya.
 
They came upon us not three days out from the Targadian Mountains, shadowy figures in the night. At first we thought them simple bandits preying on hapless travellers; desperate rogues who'd made a fatal mistake in selecting their victims. We imagined we would kill them easily enough... but we were wrong. Had Arla not been left behind, sick with fever, we may have mastered them. But in our arrogance, we underestimated them. Ziema battled formidably, saving many of our lives, but that only aided our attackers' true intentions. They wanted not to rob us or kill us but to steal away Ziema herself! 
 
And they succeeded.

And it wasn't only her they took. Some of my most experienced warriors also vanished that night.
 
In the aftermath, stranded in the Aurigan wilds, bloodied and exposed, there was little we could do except carry on with our original plan - without Ziema or the others.
Every day the same questions burned in my mind. Who kidnapped Ziema? Did one of our party betray our intentions to the spineless trinity who rule the Forgotten in Dagaari Tanga - the fearful High Consecrate and the feeble Masters of the Divinities? Those rulers who have forgotten our motto: "We are the power in the shadows"? Or was she taken by some other enemy who escapes my attention? The questions burn. The one that burns the most though is this: Where is she now?
 
Before we settled $EmpireCity, all I could do was seethe and agitate. Now, though? Now I can begin to get answers.
Now I will do everything in my power to find Ziema.
And have my vengeance on those who stole her away.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter1Objective">Your plan to rebuild a new Forgotten civilization has started badly. Of your two most powerful allies, Arla never made the journey, and Ziema has been kidnapped by unknown forces. Locate her.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter1Outcome">The $MinorFactionName spoke true. Ziema and the others' kidnapping was aided by rebel Forgotten, commanded by an unknown leader. They claim she is held in an enemy city. Repentant, the rebels join you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter2Title">2. Burning Questions</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter2Description">Funny, how men become eager to talk before the persuasive glow of a firebrand. Unfortunately the dissident Forgotten knew little, save for the fact that Ziema and the others were taken to a distant city. It would've been easy to order these men's deaths after their confessions, but to do so would be wasteful, not to mention unjust - they were only pieces in others' designs. A Drakken, a Vaulter, and another who kept every facet of their identity hidden are the ones who pull the strings, they tell me. 
 
Vengeance must wait, however. First I must find Ziema.
 
The fact she was captured and ferried leagues across Auriga gives me hope that she still lives. I fear, though, the state in which I will find her. I remember vividly her strength, her ambition, her hopes for our people. Back in Dagaari Tanga, when we plotted our escape together, seeking a better way for the Forgotten, I remember the conviction of her words: "We will not survive the coming winters by cowering in the mountains like rats. We will control Auriga by embracing who we are! We are the power in the shadows..." I hope she still has the means to speak those words.
 
Time is my greatest enemy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter2Objective">The rebel Forgotten who have joined your armies claim Ziema and the others are being held captive somewhere in $CityName. Someone, somewhere in the city must know more.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter3Description">I should feel relief and happiness upon seeing Ziema back in our midst. And I do. But those emotions are eclipsed by much more powerful feelings; feelings of rage and frustration. A desire for vengeance. Though Ziema is broken and a remnant of her former self, even in her weakened state I see that same glimmer in her eye. She cannot yet talk of who her captors were nor for what purpose they tortured her. That will come in time. For now, I must do everything in my power to rebuild her strength.
 
Of Arla, the third pillar of our trinity, I hear whispers that she wandered from Daagari Tanga in a fever; her body found in the wilderness. If true, the Forgotten have lost a great leader. We will honour her by forging the greatest Forgotten civilization ever to grace Auriga - one able to withstand, perhaps even flourish, in the grim winter that comes.
 
Ziema's dual swords, Shadowbinder and Shadowbrand, lie broken, exactly as we found them beside her slumped body. When her strength has returned, we will find a way to make them whole again.
 
She will need them to have her vengeance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter3Objective">Ziema is a pale shadow of her former self after her incarceration and torture. You must send her out into the world to rebuild her strength - and reforge her swords, Shadowbinder and Shadowbrand.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter4Title">4. Ziema Returns</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter4Description">Ziema paces like a caged animal, clawing her hair as she tries to recall her tormentors. "I remember the Drakken most of all. In the darkness, devoid of any light save the torches they carried with them, I lost track of the days, but he would always be the first to have his turn. After waking me with a pail of freezing water, he would begin by peeling a fresh strip of skin from my flesh, small and perfectly rectangular. With his fetid lizard breath spilling over me, he said that if I could count the strips I would know how many days I'd been held."
 
As she speaks the cold rage gathers inside me. During her earlier years when the Masters were bolder, Ziema led many raids against the Drakken. Perhaps this Drakken is one of those left nurturing an icy grudge. "I have crossed his path before, I'm sure," she says. "The way he eyed me with such hatred, the way he whispered the same two words in his bastard tongue. He knows me." She tells me one of the claws of his left hand was missing, a misshapen stump where the digit should be. "Loose me, and let me track him down. I will cut his monstrous head from his scaled body - "
 
"And I will gladly sharpen the blade for you, Ziema," I interrupt. "But we must be clever, lest these cockroaches scurry into the dirt never to be seen again. And our missing companions may also never return."
 
I counsel that our influence must reach into every nook of Auriga, and that we must resurrect lost ways If we are to track these men. "By extending our eyes, our ears, our reach to every corner of the world, we will first widen the lasso. Then we will tighten the noose."</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter4Objective">Ziema is strong again - at least in body - but the trail to her tormentors has grown cold. To have any chance of finding them, your grasp over your people - and your enemies - must also grow stronger.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter5Title">5. Revelatory Nightmares</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter5Description">Every night Ziema wakes screaming. I am always first in her chambers, first to hold her, gently rock her and tell her that she's safe now, that they can't hurt her anymore. Last night as I cradled her she whispered her nightmares to me. Dark visions of sharpened blades, faceless monstrosities, her body twisted into painful geometries. "The Drakken inflicted pain, but he never scared me - not like the Vaulter woman." Ziema tells me the woman was cruel, methodical, and never uttered a single word. "Her methods seemed almost familiar..."
 
I ask her what cause this Vaulter woman might have had to wish to harm her. Ziema goes still as stone in my arms. "I remember." During one of her earliest missions for the Warfarer's Divinity, she tells me, her scouting party came across a small company of Vaulters in Forgotten territory. All escaped save for one young girl who they imprisoned in a threadbare cell in an crumbling fort. Ziema was the guard. A malicious Forgotten interrogator tortured her for secrets she didn't possess. "After every interrogation the girl begged me to help her, but I was too cowardly to do anything," she says. "One day we unlocked her cell and simply left."
 
"Darkness begets darkness," I whisper. "One question remains: how did they find us on that night?"
 
"I think the one who always watched, still and silent, can answer that riddle. I suspect he is... a Forgotten."
 
Her words stun me. One of our own?
 
If this is true, we can only outwit this Forgotten by improving old methods while learning new deceits.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter5Objective">The three who tortured Ziema still roam free. If they are to be found new methods of enquiry must be learnt, new tools and technologies seized. Evolve your empire into a true "power in the shadows."</LocalizationPair>

As our power grows, as our influence reaches further, we hear more and more idle talk from underground drinking pits, gossip in bustling street markets, and loose tongues in our enemies' corridors of power. Several sources, informers across Auriga, have reported that the Vaulter woman we seek leads a ragtag army in the wastes of some nearby region. The latest reports suggest she hides in one of the ruins of the area. They tell me her name is Agi.
 
"Agi," Ziema whispers when I relay her the name. "Yes, that was her name. Agi."
 
I notice the gentle way in which she says the name, like she is sheltering a beautiful, fragile flower in her cupped hands. "Do you still seek vengeance?" I ask.
 
Ziema's voice hardens. The Vaulter, she tells me, showed not a jot of emotion save for a cold glee as she performed her tortures. Her hands were scorched and twisted claws, her actions as cold and methodical as a butcher carving up a haunch of meat, and her eyes sunken chips of blue ice. "Agi died a long time ago.

Of my warrior companions there is still no sign.
 
As I feared, leads are few and far between. Whoever the Forgotten may be who masterminded the whole affair, I have not a clue. Every Forgotten I suspect, every Forgotten who had reason to hate us - to wish that the fragile shoots of our plans for a new, greater civilization wither and die - comes back clean. Of the Drakken there is likewise little sign, but through diligent work we did discover the loose thread that will be his unravelling: his name.
 
Archivist Mukangung.
 
A name is a powerful thing. With it we can learn the Drakken's life story. Where he was born, where he travelled, where those who he loves reside. Ziema now understands why his desire for vengeance against her burned so bright: She led the incursion against his Drakken kin and their eyrie at the Gahve Pass, claiming after the massacre that she had not noticed the flags of surrender. A merciful death, given what becomes of prisoners of war in the Targadian Mountains. Fortunately for us, there are others he still cares about...
 
If we can't go to him, we will make him come to us.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter7AltTitle">7. Where the Drakken Flies</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter7AltDescription">Ziema walks with her head held a little higher, her lips set a little less tighter. The Vaulter's death has lifted her, but she still aches to root out her remaining two tormentors. In the aftermath of Agi's death, I imagine they have gone to ground like the vermin they are. News travels fast in this land.
 
Of my warrior companions there is still no sign.
 
As I feared, leads are few and far between. Whoever the Forgotten may be who masterminded the whole affair, I have not a clue. Every Forgotten I suspect, every Forgotten who had reason to hate us - to wish that the fragile shoots of our plans for a new, greater civilization wither and die - comes back clean. Of the Drakken there is likewise little sign, but through diligent work we did discover the loose thread that will be his unravelling: his name.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter8Title">8. Armies Massing</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter8Description">The trail for the Forgotten who masterminded Ziema's kidnap and torture, like Auriga itself, grows cold. We are the power in the shadows now - listening, watching, manipulating, even killing across the world - and yet this Forgotten, this ultimate betrayer, escapes our grasp. Ziema agitates, consumed with finding her. I worry for her sanity.
 
Despite our victories, despite our readiness for the endless winter, until she is found - until we learn of my companions' fates - neither of us can have peace. And then...like something from a dream...a letter arrives. 
My hand still shakes just like when I first read the words.
 
I am the Forgotten you seek.
I am the power in the shadows, risen high among the $EmpireName.
I hold those you still seek.
Come, wreak your vengeance.
 
And so we will.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter8Objective">The Forgotten who masterminded Ziema's kidnap and torture, has planted deep roots in the $EmpireName empire. If you are to have your vengeance you must prepare for war.</LocalizationPair>

Other empires can also help to complete this objective.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestReplicants-Chapter8Outcome">My companions are free and enraged; the truth was cold and brutal. It was Arla! Co-conspirator, soul mate. "You were weak," she rasps.

To make up for this lack, he developed prowess in running, jumping, and lifting with his legs, gaining strength far beyond any of his clanspeople. Unsurprisingly, his charging attacks during a wintry Bos raid earned him his wintername, as with sheer force he crashed through their lines and rounded up those who fled. Though his wings finally grew to full size, his trunk-like legs and superhuman endurance have given him a dominating presence and his feats in battle have given him a legendary status.</LocalizationPair>

In the case of Xoyos, to have one at all would be viewed as an offense to those who did not survive. Those who were lost live on within him, however, as Xoyos leads with the drive and passion of a hundred Allayi - regardless of how difficult the goal or how long the task.</LocalizationPair>

Seeing his mentor, Calyos, fall in battle, Rabos flew into a rage and transformed into a frenzied berserker. Wielding a great sledgehammer as if it was a pocket knife and shattering the waves of aggressors who tried to fight past the body of Calyos. When the battle was over and his rage cooled, Rabos chose to turn from the Epistle and became a war leader, leaving the spiritual good of his clan to a less temperamental Allayi.</LocalizationPair>

His wintername came unexpectedly; after a tortuous encounter with Shades deep within an Endless ruin Ystros came out able to describe the tale and the location with stunning precision and accuracy. Whether Dust-enhanced or not, his gifted memory makes him a great administrator who has a disconcerting ability to grasp both the details and the big picture better than anyone.</LocalizationPair>

In fact, nobody realized that rather than ignoring what was going on she was in fact looking, smelling, hearing, tasting the air, and staying alert. More interested in figuring out what was happening than in discussing it, she quickly became a respected - if silent - tracker and hunter. Even as an adolescent, in the middle of the harshest Dark Seasons, Eayos would suddenly appear out of nowhere bearing roots, berries, and game that she had ferreted out when far more experienced hunters came home empty-handed. If anything walks, grows, throbs, hums, trills, germinates, eats, lives or dies on Auriga, there is a good chance that Eayos knows about it.</LocalizationPair>

The Epistle, page 4
----------
 
So the burden, and the glory, fall to me.
 
We have taken the return of the Guardians as a signal; from the forests and the mountains we come together to rebuild our culture. In my hands sits the waxed and oiled leather pouch, black with age, that contains the Epistle of Vros Grayspire and the Euchologion, the ways of prayer.
 
Through all the Silent Years we have guarded these scrolls, handing them down from father to son, waiting for the moment when we could once again serve our role as sentinels of Mother Auriga. We are together except for the flying Skyfin, a symbol of our power and freedom. With its strength we can reclaim our place by her side.
 
These Pearls, the 'winter fruit' of the Epistle, signal our resurgence. We will harvest them, and use them to build an altar to Auriga. As we do Her bidding, we will grow our own strength.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestWinterShifters-Chapter1Objective">Your people are converging after centuries in the wilderness. You lack only the Skyfin, a powerful ally and totem of your people.

----------
 
Now that our altar has been founded, and our faith renewed, we shall begin to impose the will of Auriga. Though our cause is just and we are Her Chosen we will still remain humble; there is much to learn - and with knowledge comes strength.
 
Strength and knowledge will both be necessary if we are to defeat the tools and lackeys of the Profaners and save Mother Auriga. We do not fear conflict rather we will revel in the test of our faith. And those who dare to challenge us will understand why the wolves live in fear of the shepherds.</LocalizationPair>

----------
 
It has been generations since the Allayi have come together. When the Guardians were felled we fled; the weapons of the Profaners were too terrible, and their war ghouls the worst. But as all things evil they too have passed - though the damage they did was horrific. Now Auriga seeks us out to heal and protect her. Some whisper that she is dying, that the longer Dark Seasons are a sign of her end. Of The End. But I say that the Pearls, and the offerings we give to her, will help us both.

----------
 
I believe that we now have the strength to do this. To find the old places where our ancestors and Grayspire lived and prayed.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestWinterShifters-Chapter7Description">"...harvest Her Pearls where they rise... these are the gifts of Auriga to the Allayi, the Chosen, who will save Her from eternal winter..."
 
----------
 
The Allayi look to me, and I have no answers. In the arcana of the Winter Tree, the Altar itself, it is indicated that the Pearls we so gleefully harvest are not a gift to the Chosen, but the last dying energies of Mother Auriga. In defiance of the wisdom of the Epistle!
 
Which is correct? Are they ours to take? Others will if we do not, and She does not reabsorb them if they are left to lie. What are these Pearls? Why do we have them? 
 
I can only answer that these things exist, that they help us, and that even the grimmest sacrifice, if accepted with piety and love, is a blessing. 
 
I hope...
 
I hope, for my soul and for Our Mother, that this theory of mine is right. For in an ancient grotto, a place once holy to the Allayi, we have found a way to defeat the Nemesis -- a weapon that even the magics of the Profaners could not stop. It will take all of our strength to forge it and prepare our troops. May Mother Auriga watch over us...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestWinterShifters-Chapter7Objective">The damage done by the Profaners is so grave that the Pearls of Auriga appear to be Her last drops of blood, not some blessed gift.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestWinterShifters-Chapter8Title">8. The Fate of Auriga</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestWinterShifters-Chapter8Description">I can no longer quote the Epistle. Whatever winter it was, long ages ago, from which Vros Grayspire saved Her, it was not like this Dark Season. I do not have the heart to take up a pen and alter the sacred text, so I put it aside and face the future without it. Without prophecies, without promises, with only the hands and the hearts of the Allayi.
 
This much, at least, is clear: The Pearls are for us, meant to save us from whatever fate awaits Her. She would save Her children, Her Chosen, from the long winter that comes.
 
It has happened before - the Long Sleep, the long Dark Season, and at the end Auriga rises anew. This is the best we can hope for; that we can bring Her to a state where She can sleep the sleep of restoration and flower again.
 
If we can achieve that, I will have hope for the Allayi and for Mother Auriga. Our role is to accompany, not to save; we must ease her into her rest, not fight to delay it. If we can reign supreme on Auriga, we can see to it that she goes gently into that Long Sleep.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestWinterShifters-Chapter8Objective">We have little choice but to fight on, preparing ourselves for the Dark Season that lies ahead. If we cannot save Mother Auriga, we can at least survive so that someone will remember Her.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%NavalPackLore">While much is known of the surface of Auriga, its oceans still guard many mysteries. Weathered fortresses, certainly creations of another age, still house a secretive people called the Fomorians who serve some ancient purpose. But while the nations of Auriga learn to meet, trade, and war on the seas, another force rises from beneath them. They are - or is? - the Morgawr, a twisted and possessed people that seem to be symbiotic creations of sea life and other, unimaginable species. It will be necessary to confront them, defy them, and understand the new powers they harness. Or, equally likely, succumb to their strength.</LocalizationPair>

An entity that is a single mind of many bodies, Morgawr has a powerful compulsion to dominate and control the minds of others in order to achieve their ultimate intent.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroNameSeaDemonsHero1Version3Title">Cetassa III</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileSeaDemonsHero1Title">Cetassa</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileSeaDemonsHero1Description">Cetassa is a towering emotional presence among the Morgawr even though, like all Morgawr, she is but one spirit in a vast shared mind. Larger than average and with a grave force of character, she seldom gives an opinion but when she does, it is heard and respected. Cetassa is an Original; one of the Morgawr who awoke and broke out of their imprisonment years ago, forming the initial core of the society. The ordeal of the time spent in stasis gave her unusual strength as well as a depth of thought that brings instant obedience to her suggestions. All Heroes stand out from the mass, of course, but even among Heroes the presence of Cetassa in communal thought is like a great, silent shadow. This psychological power is echoed in the power of her mind, as she finds it both easy and entertaining to dominate lesser beings.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroNameSeaDemonsHero2Version1Title">Strio</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroNameSeaDemonsHero2Version2Title">Strio II</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroNameSeaDemonsHero2Version3Title">Strio III</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileSeaDemonsHero2Title">Strio</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileSeaDemonsHero2Description">As one of the many bizarre mutations that characterize the Morgawr population, Strio has growths that clearly indicate genetic material of conch or nautilus shells. During his early years he learned that these shells, if filled with air, could be made to create sonic vibrations of most unusual - and sometimes pleasing - frequencies. When communes are full of Morgawr in deep thought, or even merely trading news, Strio will often create musical counterparts to soothe listeners, make them vulnerable to suggestions, or even enrage them if it suits him. When defending he will play a series of tones that he refers to as the "Song of the Morgawr", designed to instill morale in his own troops while confusing the enemy. Music is a powerful force, and when tied to Morgawr intent it can be a very unpleasant weapon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroNameSeaDemonsHero3Version1Title">Sclera</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroNameSeaDemonsHero3Version2Title">Sclera II</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroNameSeaDemonsHero3Version3Title">Sclera III</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileSeaDemonsHero3Title">Sclera</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileSeaDemonsHero3Description">The Morgawr are a telepathic society that identifies individuals by their minds, and as such has little need for names. Sclera, however, has held stubborn to his as it was all that remained of one of the tags on his chains when he awoke, deep under the seas. As one of the "Originals", Sclera spent ages in suspended animation with the incipient madness of isolation and imprisonment working on his mind. He was blessed with a genius-level intellect, however, and turned to logic, math, and feats of memorization to avoid losing his sanity - a risk that may still be lurking just around the corner. When the Rising occurred, and the Originals freed themselves to form the Morgawr society, Sclera showed two very interesting characteristics. First, a genius for the problem-solving aspects of managing and leading, and second, a deep terror of being left alone. Sclera often uses the Morgawr's natural powers of mind control to ensure he is surrounded by followers - and delicately cleanses the suspicion that they have been used as psychological crutches or living shields.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroNameSeaDemonsHero4Version1Title">Ploria</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroNameSeaDemonsHero4Version3Title">Ploria III</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileSeaDemonsHero4Title">Ploria</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileSeaDemonsHero4Description">Like all Morgawr, Ploria is a heavily mutated and corrupted product of various ancient species from Auriga - and perhaps even other worlds. In Ploria's case, however, one of the worst mutations is his unusual aggressiveness. A skilled hunter and killer, he will often attack those who disagree with him not only mentally - which is normal in a telepathic society - but physically, which is viewed as a terrible breach of protocol. Were it not for his usefulness as a warrior-assassin for the Morgawr, it is likely that he would long ago have been selected as an Aberrance and put down for his violent nature. He wears his aggressiveness with pride, not shame, and has declared that he will seek and slay one of every major life form on the planet. As a spirit of the dark and a hunter of sentient beings, it will likely not be long before he achieves this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroNameSeaDemonsHero5Version1Title">Iracu</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroNameSeaDemonsHero5Version3Title">Iracu III</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileSeaDemonsHero5Title">Iracu</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileSeaDemonsHero5Description">Iracu's youth was spent similar to most of the Morgawr who were hatched after the Originals broke free. Iracu remembers a society fighting to understand and define itself; a society that had not existed before and was in a process of recreating itself day-to-day like a living organism. Highly invested in the goal of forging a stable society, Iracu took it upon herself to purge many of the more horrific mutations who were too weak, crippled, or demented to join a functioning civilization. She named them "Aberrances", and in the matter of judgement became jury and executioner. Cold as any Morgawr and relentless in excising frailty and corruption, Iracu's fame as a pragmatic and unemotional leader has given her wide support in spite of her willingness to serve rapid and terminal justice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroNameSeaDemonsHero6Version1Title">Difore</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroNameSeaDemonsHero6Version2Title">Difore II</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroNameSeaDemonsHero6Version3Title">Difore III</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileSeaDemonsHero6Title">Difore</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileSeaDemonsHero6Description">A precise thinker and defensive strategist, Difore always preferred the exploration of caverns and fissures as well as the analysis of the strangely two-dimensional tactics of land battles. She came to find the seas disorienting and now feels less at home in deep water, much preferring crawling on rocks and reefs to swimming - where danger could come from any direction. Her curiosity with caves led her to breach a sunken ruin in a rather violent manner, and the resulting Dust cloud changed her forever. Though still capable of communing with the Morgawr group mind, she is one of only a handful who occasionally feels the need to pull back, turn off the thoughts of others, and reflect silently on her own. This has made her an unpredictable entity and a very dangerous foe, and allowed her to focus her will with great clarity.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestSeaDemons-Chapter1Description">Morgawr awakens. Darkness. 
 
Moves heads, limbs. Presses out, grabs, crushes, twists. Breaks weakened bars, shatters cracked glass. Morgawr moves.
 
Freedom. After uncountable years. Flees the structures, the caves, into the water. Dark water. Too cold, too dark. Hides too many enemies. Too many memories.
 
Freedom!
 
Morgawr moves in the darkness, finds others. So few. 
 
Rises. Seeks the light. Seeks... Air. Land. Fire. The forge. Walls. Weapons. These are strange images... Memories?
 
Morgawr remembers the time in prison. Asleep but aware; the horror of immobility, impotence, imprisonment. Must breathe the air, use fire, build and conquer, spread across the world. Never to be imprisoned again. 
 
Never to let a power survive that could imprison. Never to be the weaker.
 
Morgawr grows.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestSeaDemons-Chapter1Objective">The Morgawr have awakened and destroyed the places that held them prisoner. To continue their war for freedom, they need stronger cities and better armies. </LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestSeaDemons-Chapter2Description">Morgawr is not in chains, but is not free. Free means unchallenged. Free means unthreatened. 
 
Freedom costs. Must grow, be stronger, be crueler. Freedom is having no equals. Having no threats. 
 
The fortresses threaten. Built by the jailers, smelling of the jailers. Run by the jailers' beasts. Fortresses must be taken, controlled, conquered, mastered. Fortresses can never be trusted.
 
Start there. Make the fortresses grovel. Never trust the fortresses, the smell of the jailers. What other creations of the jailers might be lurking within them?
 
Morgawr rises from the waters. Spies the fortresses. Opens the doors, climbs the walls. Silent, merciless, cold, relentless. 
 
Sees the terror in the eyes of the jailers' beasts.
 
Morgawr is content.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestSeaDemons-Chapter2Objective">The Morgawr must find peace their own way - by dominating others, not by trusting them.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestSeaDemons-Chapter2Outcome">Morgawr does not find peace in victory. So many fortresses, whispers of so many empires and so much danger. Morgawr must be the strongest, most dangerous, most feared.
 
That is freedom.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestSeaDemons-Chapter3Description">Morgawr has a city, many minds, food, shelter. But feels the gnawing of fear, the hatred that lies outside. 
 
The Jailors' remnants are everywhere in the sea and on the land; the Jailors' dupes and tools like those in the fortresses that remain on the oceans.
 
Morgawr looks down, sees the darkness it came from, feels fear. Things lurk down there - remnants of prisons and hatred and memories of terror. But Morgawr must face fear to be free of fear. Will dive, hunt, find answers.
 
Might also find madness, but must face the terrors in its minds also, to truly be free. </LocalizationPair>

Some species are lesser and no threat. Other species will try to take Morgawr freedom, return Morgawr to chains. Those must be destroyed.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalTalk#0033Description">You hear from local rumors that a Fomorian group belonging to $InitialFortressName has fled to one of your cities. Rumors also spread of a certain fortress where an authoritarian government has concentrated all the wealth in its hands through slave labor and martial law. 
However, the truth of the stories must be known, and you need to find out if these rumors are true and whether or not that Fortress is a potential risk. It is time to round up some suspects and see what you can learn.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0001Description">One of your captains started to behave erratically, and her crew reports that she saw something rising from the waters that drove her mad. Unfortunately she was carrying something valuable, and one of the local pirates took advantage of her madness to steal it.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0002Title">Curiosity Kills</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0002Description">It started as a bit of fun due to natural curiosity. Why not do a bit of poking and exploring to see what's inside the ruins? There's no harm done, of course. Except in this case, where your nosy crew has disturbed the most holy shrine of some local Fomorians - the place where they say their ancestors were banished from the skies and took to living in the waters. It is their yearly time of remembrance, arguably the worst possible month to have done this.
It is too late to run. Prepare yourself.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0003Description">The more you sail the waters, the more you realize you are gliding on a thin surface above deep and unfathomable mysteries. Are there lost kingdoms, unspeakable horrors, or both? 
Gnarled deckhands, skilled wrights, and sunburned pirates speak of an ancient object, lying in a place shrouded in mystery and death, that may teach you more about what lurks beneath you.
It may be dangerous, but what is life without a bit of risk?</LocalizationPair>

Though it appears to be randomly scarred and scratched by age, it could be that those marks indicate undersea terrain, wind patterns, and locations of Fomorian fortresses.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0005Description">Something hums in the depths of this ruin - in spite of the age, the remorseless gnawing of the seawater, and the earthquakes, a sealed chamber has withstood all that Time could throw at it. 
 
Analysis shows that this wondrous mechanism requires Dust to be opened; after all this time it is a simple lack of magical energy that keeps the vault from powering itself open. Produce enough Dust - just enough to increase Auriga's magical store of it - and your experts can open the chamber.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0005Objective">Increase the Dust production in Auriga by just enough to re-energize the planet and the vault.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0006Description">The Fomorians in the Fortress complain of feast and famine, of nets bursting with fish and yet weeks when the juiciest bait and chum bring nothing. Should you show that the bounties of Auriga are at your beck and call, that your people never want for a full belly, they will view you with almost god-like reverence.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0006Objective">Show your power over the vicissitudes of weather.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0007Title">A Little Spine</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0007Description">A great sea-snake lurks in this ruin, collecting treasures and trophies from lesser victims. It appears to be unique and ancient, most likely the result of some strange magical or scientific accident. It is clearly belligerent, but it is also smart - and does not wish to start a war with an entire empire.
 
The serpent will leave you in peace, and even send you on your way with a treasure, but first you must prove you are not a weakling that will lose its gift...</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0008Description">Enough reports come from captains and admirals that you begin to worry of beasts beneath the seas - beasts larger than fleets. More sightings means there will be increased contact, and that means damaged ships and a need for greater defenses. Yet you are already involved in many conflicts, and resources are not infinite...
 
It may be time to think of a truce, which can bring benefits in trade or technology that war does not.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0008Objective">Danger may rise from the seas and too many wars may weaken your empire; think of a Truce.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0009Description">The mystery of Auriga's grim winters is unsolved. Perhaps the huge portion of the globe covered in water holds some answers?

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0010Title">Search and Rescue</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0010Description">Searching this ruin you come across the wreckage of a poorly planned expedition. Using some sort of incomprehensible construction of rubber hoses and glass bowls the survivors claim they were searching the ruins when some vast beast came upon them, killing and devouring.
They managed to scavenge some supplies, but their boat was destroyed so now they are stranded. Give them a vessel to rebuild their expedition, and in return, they will share some of the luxuries they recovered before disaster struck.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0010Objective">The wrecked scavengers need a new ship, return to them with a Naval Unit that they can use to rebuild.</LocalizationPair>

They cannot run proper experiments in these conditions, and request your help.
For samples of your pure products, protected and enhanced by Dust, they would be willing to offer one of their heirloom treasures.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0012Description">A solitary Fomorian comes alongside your ship, bored and lonely after days of travel in a small skiff.
You invite him on board, and he regales you with stories of the technical mysteries of the towers and fortresses in the seas, though the more he talks the less you understand. Perhaps if your empire improved its scientific knowledge, you could comprehend his strange words and learn more of the enigmas of the oceans.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0012Objective">In order to better understand what the Fomorian is telling you, improve your scientific knowledge.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0013Description">Tremors indicate something terrible is happening near this ruin - but whether it is a volcano, an earthquake, or a coming Leviathan you cannot tell. The boat full of Fomorian pilgrims anchored there doesn't care, however, as they claim this site is holy to their study of What Once Was, without which they cannot make proper decision to determine What Might Be. 
You can only hope to convince them to relocate - and share their knowledge - if you take a bit of effort.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SideQuestNavalInteract#0014Description">It is clear that the Endless were guardians of technologies and designs that are far more advanced than the ruins and odd artifacts that have come to light. Perhaps, somewhere in the depths of the seas, you can find the plans for the construction of vessels that would help you to build something more impressive - and dangerous. The oceans of Auriga are up for anyone's taking, and blueprints for a warship and its weapons would be highly advantageous.

There is a ruin out there that you have heard of; a lost ruin on the far side of this ocean - perhaps even on the far side of other oceans, also as yet undiscovered.

A monster has been reported out in the deep blue. Wild-eyed mariners claim it is the size of great ships, even the size of islands. It has been attacked and even wounded, but never killed. A mass of tentacles attached to a great maw, the only good news to have come from these tall tales is that there apparently is only one - but that it is a wanderer and appears anywhere, rising suddenly from the depths to strike and feed.
 
The Roving Clans call it Muumang, the Ardent Mages refer to it as Durxeri, and it is Gelysbyr to the Morgawr. Whatever its name, stories abound of it and ships have broken on it, little is known except for a few scarce facts. First, should it die, it will finally disgorge the tons of wealth it has been ingesting for decades. Second, should any part of it survive, it will regenerate itself. Third, you probably need a bigger boat...</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MakeWarNotLovePackLore">War can have a powerful and devastating effect on everything from a single person to an entire people. More intimately, there are times when an individual's hopes and desires are ruthlessly ground beneath the wheels of the great machines unleashed when countries fall into conflict. In those times, regardless of one's intentions or origins, one has no choice but to make war, not love...</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileMezariHero2Title">Commander Irjsko Lasmak</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileMezariHero2Description">Another ambitious and talented child from a family with a long history of producing them, Irjsko rose easily through the ranks of the Mezari security forces. Though the Mezari had only recently fallen to Auriga, she felt at home in the caverns of their subterranean holding where her natural curiosity made her a valuable explorer and forager. In teams or alone she was famous for extending the mapped space of the Mezari nation and vastly improving their understanding of the underworld realm to which they were still adapting. It was during a solo scouting expedition - the sort of thing she did regularly to keep from getting bored - that Irjsko discovered a new and evidently well-maintained hatch that led out to the unknown and reputedly lethal surface of Auriga. Curious and suspicious, she staked it out and soon discovered a horrifying secret: A band of renegade scientists and ideologues called the Eugenicists were testing survival technology on living subjects. Sneaking from that door to deep down in their labs and living spaces, Irjsko spent several rage-filled days detailing everything about the operation. It was during one of the surface expeditions that she met a kindred soul, Bayari Kulaa, a test subject with a will of iron and a taste for revenge. While those days have never formally been recorded, and Irjsko's records of the operation, though precise, were sparse, the passion with which she spoke of the Eugenicists and their subjects indicates that her relationship with Kulaa was more than just sisters in arms.
 
Soon after, Irjsko left the lab area to make her report and return with troops. However, in the time she was gone the lab and everyone in or near it disappeared after a series of murderous - and carefully-planned - fires. Irjsko made many subsequent trips to the surface, relentlessly tracking Kulaa and her companions. Her attitude changed drastically, and any stragglers they found were dealt with ruthlessly. Nevertheless Irjsko's career continued to rise, and she held many top posts in the Mezari society. But she was never the same after the Eugenicists incident, forever a colder and grimmer warrior.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileMezariHero3Title">Sable Deceiver Bayari Kulaa</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileMezariHero3Description">Known today as First of the Forgotten, back then Kulaa was merely the toughest and most resilient of the test subjects of a mad Mezari mutation program. An orphan, thief, and troublemaker, Kulaa was one of the many societal outcasts who was taken by the Eugenicists, a secret organization within the Mezari , and turned into guinea pigs for testing survival biotech. Their goal may have been noble - the ability to survive on the hostile surface of Auriga - but their methods were utterly repugnant. Kulaa's natural resilience served her well during these grueling years of suffering, and against all odds she began smuggling useful objects out of the Mezari labs under the eyes of her guards. She made many accompanied sorties to the surface, planning for that one day when she would not return when the whistle blew. Kulaa kept pushing that day out, however, out of compassion for her fellow subjects and an increasingly deep desire to commit not only escape, but also revenge. Her unexpected ally came in the form of a Mezari guard captain, Irjsko Lasmak, who had become suspicious of the activities of the Eugenicists and tracked them through the tunnels and caverns to their facility. Little else is known of the relationships between the two women other than the fact that they spent many long and intense days together; the one gathering evidence and the other, loot. The day that Irjsko returned to her superiors to make a report stained with tears and blood, was the last day that Kulaa and the several hundred test subjects were ever seen. It was also the day that an entire section of the caverns and all the Eugenicists' work disappeared in explosions and fire...
 
Kulaa became the de facto leader of the tribe, and it is largely thanks to her that they survived the grim ordeal of the poisoned and mutated world that Auriga had become. Finding peace in the high mountains, the Forgotten made her birthday their national celebration and respectfully refer to her as the first, and the greatest, of the Sable Deceivers.</LocalizationPair>

To this end, he became a stone shaman of unparalleled skill, fashioning an entourage of golems that allowed him to range into otherwise inhospitable climes of fire and desolation. Makani encountered more pockets of machine activity than anybody else, and was one of the loudest voices cautioning that their threat shouldn't be underestimated. Sadly, his words were not heeded. On Auriga, Makani's wanderlust is undiminished, and now he has even more reason to roam the uncharted wastes.</LocalizationPair>

Were it not for the actions of Custodian Aktyl, Takari would've no doubt been left abandoned in that pit of despair. Aktyl, however, understood her potential worth, and had her smuggled onto the Aurigan-bound starship where she slept in anonymity. Now free on Auriga, Takari is once again a formidable leader, but one that keeps her reservations about the Endless to herself.</LocalizationPair>

A clumsy craftsman with a poor grasp of the theories of Dust alchemy, Akuma's life was one of wretched shame until the day of the Endless's arrival. Already aware of the machines' threat to the Kapaku's ash and stone civilization, Akuma used his family connections to create a political platform that cast the Concrete Endless as the Kapaku's divine saviors, quickly establishing a populist following as his faith bore fruit. Instrumental in founding the Temple of Our Saviors, Grand Cleric Akuma is a natural orator who now wields great power among his people.</LocalizationPair>

When the machines arrived, she was one of the first to appreciate that they were complex machines, and subsequently spent much thought on their likely origin. Later, after the Concrete Endless saved the Kapaku from the machine threat, it was clear that the volcanoforming devices needed to terraform Auriga would best be entrusted to Pali and her fellow geomancers.</LocalizationPair>

A bright, capable youth, Haukea felt lost by the spirallng events, and lived in a state of dazed trauma for a long time before Custodian Aktyl announced the founding of the Koni School of Elite Riders. Finally able to channel her aptitude and hurt into a productive direction, she rediscovered her love of learning, and excelled at both the philosophical and physical aspects of effectively riding a towering golem mount. Moreover, during these studies, inside Haukea grew a burning desire to use all of her energies to protect her society - a development not lost to Custodian Aktyl who subsequently selected her as his personal emissary on Auriga.</LocalizationPair>

A tireless, single-minded leader, before the disaster Custodian Tua was an isolated voice on the Council warning that the machines shouldn't be ignored. Sadly, Tua was ignored, and the Haku Clan paid a great price when the machines caused the great lava tributary that surrounded the Haku's citadel to flood its banks killing hundreds. Now carrying a deep sorrow tinged with an unmistakeable bitterness, Tua is nonetheless still a dogged, unfaltering presence on the Magma Council - and one who's voice is more readily heard. Out of all the Kapaku on Auriga, she also seems to be the one with the closest ties to the Endless' representative, Overseer Elohys.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestFlames-Chapter1Description">From the Journal of Custodian Aktyl
 
Ash buries all, in time. But still we mark the pages and pass down the stories before the all-consuming fire comes.
 
Auriga frightens. Vast sparkling blue oceans, crisp green plains, snowy wildernesses - a sickening panorama, not unlike the hellscape the machines made of our world.
 
Twelve-and-five fire-births we have witnessed, cowering and huddling in the shadow of the Endless' great vessel that carried us to this world. Why they saved us I know not. Time untold we slumbered in their cold crypts, held in dreamless sleeps by strange machines beyond our understanding. Too long, I fear.
 
If Overseer Elohys knows more of this world, it doesn't say. For all it's done for the Kapaku, the thing unsettles me: ancient living brain entombed in a walking coffin, at once magnificent and macabre. I often spy it in kindled conference with Custodian Tua, but she never shares of what they speak. More qualms... Her name would be last on my lips as one to succumb to fanaticism: her mind a grindstone, pragmatic and tenacious - But I confess, the burning reverence for the Endless that has sparked among my kin disturbs me.
 
Yes, they saved us. But as we Kapaku say: only the flame gives its warmth freely. For now, I must put these doubts aside. The time has come to strike out from our savior's cradle.
 
We will tame Auriga. One day basalt plains will stretch as far as the eye can see, great volcanoes will loom from the cracked earth, and the sickening blue of its seas will have turned to the chromed yellow and green I still remember.
 
It is our right - the Endless have promised us, and given us the tools to make it so.

The night terrors assail me every eve.
 
Half-truth, half-fantasy, they are born from my memories of the last days on our old world. Wave upon wave of killer machines moving ever closer to our last remaining settlements, crashing against our Golem defenders whose numbers dwindle every day. Beyond them I see that our beautiful world is already gone - sturdy grasses covering what was once lava plains, volcanoes smouldering into dormancy, the air disgustingly clear. And then our Endless saviors arrive, smashing the machine menace, but when Overseer Elohys reaches me he offers not a hand, but a fist.
 
I always wake at that moment, stone cold.
 
Auriga is not the empty world we were led to believe. Our scouts have unearthed more ancient mechanisms. We hoped they might be the trinkets of long dead races, perhaps the lost artefacts of Otherskins who crashed onto the world aeons ago, but when a Kapaku expedition came face-to-face with living, breathing Otherskins that dream died. I watched Custodian Tua carefully as the truth was announced at the Magma Council meeting... She knows more than she lets on.
 
Overseer Elohys plays down the Otherskins' presence. "Evolution is tenacious", it pronounces. "Life finds a way".
 
The Endless insists it didn't know that Auriga was inhabited, and that nothing has changed by the fact.
"The world is still yours to make in your own image. You have our blessing. And our tools."
 
A solemnity has fallen over the Kapaku. There are stirrings of a schism. Some whisper that we must learn more of these Otherskins before we act further, while others murmur that our volcanoforming efforts should be redoubled at once.
 
There is but one thing agreed by all: We must be prepared. Now is not the time for ideological disputes.

Auriga is not only settled with crude Otherskins. Our scouts have unearthed more ancient mechanisms - intricate, complex devices that couldn't have been fashioned by any of the races we have come across. Even our best tinkers are bewildered by the intricacy of the craftsmanship. There can be only one conclusion: a great civilization once occupied this world. I watched Custodian Tua carefully as the truth was announced at the Magma Council meeting... She knows more than she lets on.
 
Overseer Elohys claims ignorance and plays down the implications. "The galaxy is ancient", it says.
"Who knows what races spread across the stars in past eras? Today they are gone, and only primitive tribes remain. Auriga is still yours to make in your own image. You have our blessing."
 
A solemnity has fallen over the Kapaku. There are stirrings of a schism. Some whisper that we must learn more of these Otherskins before we act further, while others murmur that we must strike while we still have the advantage of surprise.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestFlames-Chapter3Description">From the Journal of Custodian Aktyl
 
We are united in our survival, but the faultlines in our society grow. After leading a geological expedition, Overseer Elohys returned only to be ambushed by an angry crowd. They jostled the Endless, accusing it of deceiving the Kapaku and demanding it admit the truth of why its people sent us to Auriga. I know not what truth they imagined, but their accusations found sympathy among many passers-by. Open riot seemed imminent until cooler heads prevailed.
 
Privately, my mind too worries over these ideas... Are we being turned into tools, here to destroy an ancient enemy of the Endless? Are we part of a cruel entertainment or experiment? Or are we, as Elohys maintains, simply unlucky to find Auriga inhabited?
 
Custodian Tua stands fast by the latter. Even more than the High Priest of the Temple of the Saviors, she is the one who has become the figurehead of the Endless' defenders. "The Endless saved us from the machines!" she rails. "Do we so easily forget? Overseer Elohys has forsaken its people, its home, its very physical form, so that we may benefit from its wisdom and survive this harsh world! Remember, we Kapaku are certainly fallible."
 
She still burns from the Magma Council's refusal to address the machine incursion early enough. To our great shame - to my great shame - most of us thought them innocent visitors. And who paid the greatest price for that willful ignorance? The Haku Clan. Tua's clan. 
 
So, we find ourselves split at either side of a fissure that runs deeper every day.
 
The Doubters and the Defenders.
 
I don't know who to believe. All I know is that there is no going back from Auriga. In spite of its harsh wildernesses, hostile races, and strange climes, it is now our home.

The Kapaku stand at a great crossroads.
 
The history of this world remains shrouded in smoke, but it cannot be disputed that Auriga seethes with intelligent life. Myriad races occupy the planet. From windswept deserts to snow-covered peaks, from shadowy forests to deep caverns, even in the clear, terrifying seas: The Kapaku have found creatures that are much more than simple beasts. Understanding is difficult, but we cannot deny the truth. They are civilized. They are like us.
 
Except for one vital difference. More like a gulf, in truth.
 
Where we suffer and struggle in Auriga's hellish landscapes, they flourish.
 
And that's the great dilemma that threatens to tear us apart: Do we attempt to claim the entire world, as we orginally intended, and consign them to death? Or do we try to fashion some equilibrium with these races so all may survive? The Doubters say turning Auriga into a world of rock and lava would make us no better than the machines, while the Defenders chide that we have no time for sentimentality. In their eyes, to think we can share this world is the deadliest naivet√©. Overseer Elohys and Custodian Tua share the latter opinion, of course.
 
They are not always in harmony, however. Yesterday, I spied them in furious argument, the Endless a trembling volcano of suppressed rage, while Tua spat gobs of incandescent fire. Elohys stonewalled me when I later asked the nature of their feud, while Tua answered with barefaced lies. She told me their quarrel concerned only tactics, and in the larger strategy of conquering Auriga they were united.
 
I don't know which path we should take. All I know is that there are secrets to uncover. The Endless have a past here, I am certain of it.
 
If I can't ascertain that past myself, then I must create champions who can.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestFlames-Chapter4Objective">Deep divisions risk spilling into civil war over the rights of Auriga's other races. I must learn why the Endless sent us here - fast.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestFlames-Chapter5Description">From the Journal of Custodian Aktyl
 
What is this world that the Endless have delivered us to?
 
We had expected seasons - even on a world of rock and lava we measured our lives against the shifting weather. Ash blizzards through the depths of winter, lava storms at the height of summer. We marked events and celebrations by these shifts, not least among them the annual meeting of the Magma Council when summer's meteors burn on the night sky.
 
Auriga though? Auriga's seasons are deranged. Yes, there are summers and winters here, but they are chaotic: Their arrival and length no more predictable than Overseer Elohys' moods. The long nights of twilight unsettle us too, when the world becomes cloaked in darkness and the Dust sparkles and shimmers. We know it is bound to the movement of the planet's moons, and we can even anticipate its arrival for the Endless have taught us this much, but its mechanism is frustratingly opaque.
 
But I'm merely dancing around the worst issue:
Auriga's winters are growing longer.
 
Every season the winters grow worse, the winds more biting, the snows deeper. Each time the thaws come later and later. A growing fear spreads like a disease among the Kapaku: We fear one day Auriga will become nothing more than an icy crypt for all its denizens, all our misadventures frozen for time immemorial in its snowy wastes.
 
Did the Endless send us to a doomed world?
And if so, for what reason?
 
I dare not ask Overseer Elohys bluntly, for fear of arousing its rage. But the question remains, a burning coal in my mind during the long nights. Perhaps Auriga is experiencing some growing cataclysm, it suggests. All the more reason to fight harder.
 
Elohys' patience with us wears thinner by the day. It spends more and more time secluded with Custodian Tua, plotting. I will send my champion into the political fray, and pray she can use all her wits to uncover the truth.
 
I fear we are on the brink of civil war, and worse, annihilation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestFlames-Chapter5Objective">Auriga's winters grow harsher with every passing season. Is the planet condemned to an icy death? We must find answers, but first Haukea Wai must discover what Custodian Tua and Overseer Elohys are plotting.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestFlames-Chapter5Outcome">Haukea has discovered the truth. You must come and see this, are the words she gave to the guide to relay to me. So I come. Fearfully. For Custodian Tua and Overseer Elohys have disappeared.</LocalizationPair>

Some sights you can never forget. They sear into your mind, and you will carry them with you till your flame burns out.
 
We reached the entrance tunnel to the underground site as night fell. Haukea emerged from the shadows, eyes scanning the horizon beyond us. It must've only been a matter of moons since I'd last seen her, but in her eyes I could see someone who'd aged half-a-lifetime.
 
"Thank the Fires", she managed. "You must be exhausted - and famished. Rest tonight and we can -"
 
"We go now."
 
She nodded, then snapped her fingers to call over her mount.
 
We descended in silence, deep into the earth. The air grew hotter and murkier - enough so that I could remove my breathing mask - but it was a small comfort against my trepidation. The passage sides gradually smoothed from natural formations to artificial walls, and I gasped when I first spied the familiar symbols of the Endless, their carvings half-eroded by time. Strange dead shells littered the ground, like the sloughed exoskeletons of giant insects. We passed a couple of crumpled suits, the fabric frayed, alien bones poking through the rips.
 
Then we entered the facility proper. I still shudder at the recollection. Preservation stacks filled with corpses, each displaying different variations of fatal burns. Cylindrical fluid chambers where blind, crab-like tentacled menaces still twitched in time with our footfalls. Flickering screens documenting the terrifying evolution of a fungal phage on different host species. Every chamber greeted us with fresh horrors.
 
"What is this place?" I stuttered.
 
"We believe it's an Endless military lab. They must've been researching every conceivable means of mass killing."
 
I was left speechless. The horror was too much to take in.
 
"We have uncovered another two facilities since I sent for you. Even more in the weeks prior. All deserted."
 
Everything suddenly fell into place. Auriga, the whole planet, must've been an Endless research station. A secret world of horrors until some calamity had befallen it, forcing the Endless to abandon it. Evidently, the world had healed in the time since, and the survivors had emerged from their hideaways to reclaim the surface.
 
And in the Kapaku, the Endless had found a race capable of erasing their great shame - completely. We were their hapless cleaners, and our survival mattered not a jot.
 
It was then I knew we must find Custodian Tua.
Try as i might, I couldn't believe she'd been anything but a victim of their deceit as well.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestFlames-Chapter6Objective">With its horrifying, experimental labs, Auriga became the Endless' great shame. Overseer Elohys thought it could use the Kapaku to destroy the evidence, no doubt using Custodian Tua as an orchestrator. Why had she helped though? We need to find her.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestFlames-Chapter6Outcome">We found Custodian Tua, eventually. She didn't come willingly, of course. Many Kapaku fell securing her capture, and I wonder if her words will be worth their blood. We have her weapon at least. The Magma Council awaits her testimony with great interest. As to Overseer Elohys, the Endless remains at large.</LocalizationPair>

Custodian Tua was brought before the Magma Council this morning, heavy chains rattling on the stone floor.
To my surprise, she had known of the Endless' history on Auriga before we even set eyes on the world.
 
"Before I went into cryosleep," she said, "Overseer Elohys told me that if the Kapaku were to survive on Auriga, I had to do everything in my power to help it destroy certain sites with the volcanoforming machines. It threatened to kill us all if I ever spoke of this plan. I think it chose me because my clan came so close to annihilation; it knew I wouldn't hesitate. Everything I did, I did for the Kapaku."
 
While the Council remained in stunned silence, the news of the Endless' deeds spread through the city like wildfire.
 
If Overseer Elohys is true to its word, this knowledge will doom us. Or perhaps it was lying to Custodian Tua, empty threats to keep its pawn in check. In either case, the revelation of the Endless' deception has united the Kapaku.
 
The Temple of Our Saviors has been ransacked, set to torch. None would defend the Endless now. The Kapaku are nobody's tool, nor will we be the executioners of the Otherskins from Auriga.
 
No doubt many of those races evolved from the Endless' twisted experiments. This world is their birthright, bought and paid for with the same sufffering and loss that we have endured on our own world.
 
If we are to have a future we will have to find a common path - and hope to weather out winter together.
 
First though, a more pressing matter burns. A thorough examination of Overseer Elohys' quarters has revealed the Endless' true plan: To see Auriga cleansed in a single wave of lava, using our volcanoformation machines to precipitate volcanic eruptions from pole to pole.
 
The Endless' reprehensible past will be lost, along with all life on the planet. Even we Kapaku won't survive it.
 
Overseer Elohys must be stopped!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestFlames-Chapter7Objective">Overseer Elohys is attempting to trigger a chain reaction of volcanic eruptions that will see Auriga become one unending lake of lava. It must be stopped.</LocalizationPair>

The memory of the Endless' deceit is still a raw and painful one in our collective psyche. The wounds will be a long time healing. We trusted the Endless, thought them our saviours, but they saw us as nothing more than an instrument of erasure.
 
Why did Overseer Elohys take such personal interest in the Scouring of Auriga? That remains a matter of broad speculation. Custodian Tua wasn't wrong when she said the Endless had made great sacrifices to join us here.
 
Some think it might've been one of the Endless who oversaw Auriga during its days as a world of horrors. Others that it was the scientist personally responsible for birthing the terrifying Necrophages. Others still, think perhaps it was just an ordinary Endless... A citizen riven with patriotic fervor, who couldn't abide any tarnishing of the Endless' reputation on the galactic stage.
 
We may never know.
 
The winters are growing longer and harsher. We will claim enough of Auriga to give ourselves a chance of survival, but I am not convinced this great freeze can be arrested.
Every moon we hear whispers of the Otherskins' plans for survival - escape, slumber, descent - and their ideas fuel our own geomancers' imaginations.
So we hope, and we keep the fires kindled.
 
Whatever happens, we can ensure Auriga's past is not lost. We will never destroy - or subvert - history. Not our own, nor anyone else's.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceSigned_Flames">We agree to move from #F3EAD8#Cold War#REVERT# to #F3EAD8#Alliance#REVERT#. We pray you are not deceivers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceRefused_Flames">We cannot agree to an #F3EAD8#Alliance#REVERT# in good faith. After all, we are not decided on whether we should volcanoform every last scrap of Auriga. We keep the #F3EAD8#Cold War#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceProposed_Flames">This #F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT# has lasted well. What word do you give to an #F3EAD8#Alliance#REVERT#?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceSigned_Flames">This #F3EAD8#Alliance#REVERT# is welcome. I wonder what our Endless saviors would make of it?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceRefused_Flames">An #F3EAD8#Alliance#REVERT# is difficult at this time. Our golems will help preserve the #F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceDeclarationSigned_Flames">The#F3EAD8#Cold War#REVERT# between our races is ended. Tonight we will celebrate this new #F3EAD8#Alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged_Flames">You give us no choice in the matter, so this #F3EAD8#Alliance#REVERT# is forced upon us. Auriga will not forget.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationSigned_Flames">The Council are pleased you have no fears of proposing changing this #F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT# to an #F3EAD8#Alliance#REVERT#. We agree.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged_Flames">#F3EAD8#Alliances#REVERT# are usually made through negotiation. No matter, we have faith we will prevail.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealProposed_Flames">You will do well to accept our proposal, Otherskin. We have the Endless' blessing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealAccepted_Flames">As fire burns and ash sustains, we accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSigned_Flames">The Kapaku believe this the best course. Do not fight it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealRefused_Flames">This path is not for the Kapaku. We refuse.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSigned_Flames">The Council are in agreement. This proposal will happen.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationAcknowledged_Flames">You play with fire, forcing anything on the Kapaku. Be careful, fire burns.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifySigned_Flames">We Kapaku express gratitude for your actions. May your ash harvest be bountiful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifyAcknowledged_Flames">Every Kapaku hears - and appreciates - your generous words.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningSigned_Flames">We have the power to transform this world into basalt plains and mighty volcanoes. Tread carefully.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningAcknowledged_Flames">Who are you, Otherskin, to threaten the Kapaku? Auriga is our promised land.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">We hope to find a peaceful path too. Blessings.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">We Kapaku are pleased to find ourselves with a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT#. Let us hope we can give them a fiery end. Together.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">We share a #F3EAD8#common friend#REVERT#. Does that make us friends, Otherskin? Tell me.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">We have #F3EAD8#common allies#REVERT#. This augurs well.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">Of all the Otherskins, the Kapaku are happy to share #F3EAD8#common frontiers#REVERT# with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">The #F3EAD8#War#REVERT# makes us weary. Is there not a better future for Auriga?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">We will not forget the #F3EAD8#War#REVERT#, but it needn't consume us. Let us be hopeful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">Your #F3EAD8#aggressions#REVERT# during this #F3EAD8#Cold War#REVERT# do not go unnoticed. We are watching.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">Do you miss #F3EAD8#the city we have taken#REVERT#? Good, then we might be able to move forward.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">You have #F3EAD8#taken our city#REVERT#, but we Kapaku can forgive - if your rampage is over.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">Has Auriga ever witnessed a #F3EAD8#military power as great as yours#REVERT#? We hail you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">We have risen to become the #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT# this world has ever seen. Auriga was - and is - our destiny.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">The world is not the paradise of ash and fire we were promised, but we are content that yours is Auriga's #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">Our golems watch #F3EAD8#your forces cross our territory#REVERT# with great interest. Let's hope they don't get minds of their own before your units leave.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">We are a peaceful race, forced into violence. We hope your pacifism isn't misjudged.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">We share a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT#. Is it a blessing or a curse though?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">The Kapaku see that our empires share a #F3EAD8#common friend#REVERT#. Maybe we can forge common ground too?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">Our alliance grows with the arrival of a #F3EAD8#common ally#REVERT#. May our shared fire burn even brighter.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">A #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT# separates our lands. Let us dream of a civil border, free from violence.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">The fighting is wearying. Do all suffer #F3EAD8#War fatigue#REVERT#?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">We Kapaku do not forget the enmity between our peoples, but we do not let it rule us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">We exist in a state of #F3EAD8#Cold War#REVERT#, but your #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT# could stoke new relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">The Kapaku #F3EAD8#take your city#REVERT#, not out of malice, but because the Endless promised us Auriga.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">You #F3EAD8#take the Kapaku's city#REVERT#, but you will not find our designs to your liking. Remember, you are only short-lived stewards until we reclaim that which is ours.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">With our great golem armies, #F3EAD8#the Kapaku lead the military race#REVERT#. Bear this in mind before you make your next move.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">Our armies may not be the strongest, but none will fight with greater fire than the Kapaku. Remember this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">As Auriga's #F3EAD8#greatest empire#REVERT#, every day we move closer to fulfilling our destiny to make this world our home.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">The Council recognises #F3EAD8#your peerless empire#REVERT#, and only hopes you offer sanctuary for us distant starfarers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">Why are #F3EAD8#your armies roaming in Kapaku territory#REVERT#? You would think they might be afraid of sudden changes to the terrain...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">Outwardly, #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# might be watchword of your empire, but something rotten festers in your hearts, no?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">We may share a #F3EAD8#common enemy#REVERT#, but that doesn't mean we cannot be enemies. Only the flames know what will come to pass.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">Now that we share a #F3EAD8#common friend#REVERT#, we Kapaku will be watching you even more closely. We wouldn't want our mutual friend being told any untruths, would we?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">We share a #F3EAD8#common ally#REVERT#? How strangely the lava flows sometimes. We would not have planned this path.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">How ugly your lands look from our #F3EAD8#common frontier#REVERT#! Do not think for one moment to spread into Kapaku territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">Although #F3EAD8#War Fatigue#REVERT# hangs on us heavily, the thought of further violence against your armies always inflames us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">We will never forget the #F3EAD8#last war#REVERT#, nor will we likely forgive.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">We are in a #F3EAD8#Cold War#REVERT#, yet still you commit acts of #F3EAD8#aggression#REVERT#. May your lands be riven with lava.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">We have #F3EAD8#taken your city#REVERT#, yet the Kapaku are not yet finished. Watch our golems strike out further!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">You #F3EAD8#take our city#REVERT# without a thought for the Kapaku driven out. We will not forget this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">Our #F3EAD8#military dominance#REVERT# brings shame to you and every other race on this world. The Endless were right to choose us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">#F3EAD8#Your armies might dominate#REVERT# Auriga now, but one day they will succumb to the fires.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">Perhaps your #F3EAD8#armies strayed into Kapaku lands#REVERT# by mistake. Don't make another one.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskToDeclareWarProposed_Flames">The Council seeks your help. Join us and #F3EAD8#declare war#REVERT# on these defilers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceNegotiationAskToDeclareWarProposed_Flames">A truce is one thing, but we ask you to join us and #F3EAD8#declare war#REVERT# on our enemy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersNegotiationAskToDeclareWarProposed_Flames">Our open borders give esteem to both our empires. Now join us and #F3EAD8#declare war#REVERT# on our enemy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMarketBanRemovalNegotiationAskToDeclareWarProposed_Flames">Our empires thrive with our open markets. Now help us rain fire on our enemy; #F3EAD8#declare war#REVERT# on them!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceAskToDeclareWarProposed_Flames">The peace is welcome, but now we ask you to join us and #F3EAD8#declare war#REVERT# on our enemy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceNegotiationAskToDeclareWarProposed_Flames">A peace would be welcome, but the Kapaku's greater need is your forces joining our golems and #F3EAD8#declaring war#REVERT# on this enemy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceAskToDeclareWarProposed_Flames">Join us in an Alliance and #F3EAD8#declare war#REVERT# on this enemy. Our shamans have foreseen a great victory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceAskToDeclareWarProposed_Flames">Are you willing to join an Alliance and #F3EAD8#declare war#REVERT# on our enemy? Auriga will not forget your deeds.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceAskToDeclareWarProposed_Flames">Our Alliance is powerful. Now we ask you #F3EAD8#declare war#REVERT# on our great enemy. What are your words?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPillagedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">#F3EAD8#Pillage#REVERT# Auriga's lands all you need. Only we Kapaku can sustain ourselves on ash and rock.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPillagedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">Auriga can only offer so much sustenance. #F3EAD8#Pillage#REVERT# its riches at your peril.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPillagedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">We Kapaku have already witnessed a world sacked of its riches. It didn't end well for the #F3EAD8#pillagers#REVERT# then, and it won't end well for you now.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPillagingFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">The Kapaku think you'd find richer pickings if you #F3EAD8#pillage#REVERT# elsewhere. We aim to make our lands nothing but ash and fire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPillagingFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">Your #F3EAD8#pillaging#REVERT# tests our charity towards Auriga's Otherskins. Please desist.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPillagingFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">We may come from the stars, but these lands you #F3EAD8#pillage#REVERT# are ours. Prepare for retaliations from our golems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionSpySpottedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">Please send the Kapaku's best regards to your #F3EAD8#spies#REVERT# in our midst. Yes, they have been seen!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionSpySpottedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">We know you have #F3EAD8#spies#REVERT# afoot in our lands. Let us hope they are not caught; we have many uses for lava...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionSpySpottedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">The Kapaku know of your #F3EAD8#spies#REVERT# in our lands. We are disappointed - and incandescent with rage.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPrisonerExchangeProposed _Flames">We both hold something belonging to the other. The Kapaku propose we exchange these spies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPrisonerExchangeSigned _Flames">The Council agree. An exchange of prisoners makes sense.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPrisonerRecoveryProposed _Flames">Our infiltrator in your lands shames the Kapaku. We wish to exchange prisoners to lessen this dishonor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPrisonerRecoverySigned _Flames">The return of prisoners to their respective lands is a proposal the Kapaku can agree with.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOrbsStolenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">The Pearls contain an inner fire, no? Take what you need, but no more.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOrbsStolenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">The Pearls belong to Auriga. Remember that every time you harvest one.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMantaAspiratingInMyTerritoryFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">Your Skyfin blesses Kapaku lands. We raise fires in celebration.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMantaAspiratingInMyTerritoryFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">Some Kapaku hail the sight of your Skyfin in our lands, others curse its presence. Be wary.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMantaAspiratingInMyTerritoryFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">Your Skyfine portends doom, and is unwelcome in Kapaku lands.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedEnemyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">We Kapaku hail your great deed of #F3EAD8#eliminating our enemy#REVERT#. Praise the fires!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedEnemyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">The Council recognises your deed of #F3EAD8#eliminating our enemy#REVERT#, but expresses regret that our golems were denied the opportunity to vanquish the threat.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedEnemyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">You #F3EAD8#eliminated our enemy#REVERT# that we had planned to conquer ourselves, bringing shame on the Kapaku.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedAllyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">You #F3EAD8#eliminated one of our allies#REVERT#, but they were a weak race and won't be missed. The Kapaku offer thanks.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedAllyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">Be careful who you pick to conquer next. You #F3EAD8#eliminated an ally#REVERT# with whom we'd found common ground.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedAllyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">Your savage #F3EAD8#elimination of our esteemed ally#REVERT# has not gone unnoticed. May fire rain on your lands.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedFriendFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">The Kapaku called them a companion race, but the truth was more complex. We are not unhappy you #F3EAD8#eliminated our friends#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedFriendFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">Only the fires know if you really needed to #F3EAD8#eliminate our friend#REVERT#. We Kapaku carry some sadness now they are gone.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedFriendFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">We will not forget our friends that you so brutally #F3EAD8#eliminated#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedAcquaintanceFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">The shamans bring news that you #F3EAD8#eliminated one of Auriga's races#REVERT#. We will not mourn their loss.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedAcquaintanceFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">Perhaps you should study the flames before you #F3EAD8#eliminate another of this world's peoples#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedAcquaintanceFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">We Kapaku take no joy from your #F3EAD8#murder of our mutual acquaintance#REVERT#. Flames consume you!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCityTakenFromEnemyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">We Kapaku enjoy the reports that you have #F3EAD8#taken our enemy's city#REVERT#. Flames guide you to more glories.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCityTakenFromEnemyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">The Council is not sad to see an #F3EAD8#enemy's city fall#REVERT#. The truth that you have taken it is less edifying.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCityTakenFromEnemyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">You have #F3EAD8#taken our enemy's city#REVERT# like it is your divine right. It is not, and you will be judged.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCityTakenFromAllyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">We are certain our ally rails against your #F3EAD8#taking of their city#REVERT#, but we commend your boldness.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCityTakenFromAllyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">Golems crush you! You #F3EAD8#take an ally's city#REVERT#, but it feels like the loss of one of our own.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCityTakenFromFriendFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">Our friend will survive your #F3EAD8#capture of their city#REVERT#. Only the flames know, but it may be to our advantage too.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCityTakenFromFriendFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">You #F3EAD8#take our friend's city#REVERT# without sparing a breath. We Kapaku wonder at what price though?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCityTakenFromFriendFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">We came to this world as outsiders, but your #F3EAD8#capture of our friend's city#REVERT# sends us into a fury.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAtWarWithMyAllyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">Your #F3EAD8#war with our ally#REVERT# is no concern to the Kapaku. Do your worst.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMimics-Chapter1Description">The ozonic stench of the Mages' lightning attacks fills my nostrils, mingles with the smell of burning flesh. I stumble down a narrow passage, the dim phosphorescent light from the mycelial veins causing my shadow to flicker across the craggy stone. The rock shakes. I hear the deep-throated roar of the Urkan, and my skin crawls with terror. I'm gripping a weapon, a mighty axe, but it feels like deadweight in my hands. Am I rallying my men or running from the enemy? The passage opens into another tableau of slaughter, my kinsmen dying or dead on the cold stone, their blood sprayed in crimson arcs or pooled in dark puddles. I stop dead.
 
You cannot linger. You are Toth √Ågnes. You are the First of the Bloodline. Others need you. Empty words. This is a slaughter. I know there are no others. I've brought death upon these people who followed me away from the homevaults.
 
----------
 
Memory and reality are hard to distinguish. I slumber, drifting between the past and present. The battle is over, of that I'm certain. I survived, somehow. In the here and now I feel renewal, regrowth, and a desire to reach into new places. I am confused. I slip back into my recollections, the familiarity outweighting the distress...
 
----------
 
Something grips my ankle, and my body tenses, fingers gripping the shaft of the axe. It's only a dying kinsman though. To my shame, I don't know his name. A handful of words spill from his lips, whispered and ragged.
 
"Avenge us."
 
Tears come to my eyes, but my sadness swiftly turns to fury. "I will," I reply, clutching his forearm. "I promise."</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMimics-Chapter2Title">2. The Apotheosis of Toth</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMimics-Chapter2Description">Today I awoke and discovered the horrifying truth. I am Mykara, and the Mykara is me. We are one, a symbiosis of flesh and filaments, memories and myths. In the cold light of day, I can now clearly remember how I survived.
 
The Mykara had fascinated me for a long time, when I led those who would join me away from the homevaults. It was an anicent fungal species, mycelial tendrils and mushroom fruit, no sign of what it would one day become. Growing largely in the suberranean realm, it was unseen by most, and overlooked by the rest. But I saw its potential. Sinewy, resilient, vigorous, I knew it could transform a Vaulter settlement. And it did. Crops, waste, defense. It was a wonder material. It even began to shed light on the legendary Urkan beasts, who reputedly emerged from the Aurigan crust every few centuries, before slipping back into folkloric tales...sadly one of those same beasts came under the spell of our anicent enemy, the Mages, who used it to find and then destroy us...
 
As my kinsman died in my arms, as I basked in my feelings of vengeance, a desperate idea came to me. The Mykara had brought me to this juncture, and the Mykara would grant me my revenge. After all, in my heart, I'd always been convinced it was much more than a mere, mindless organism. I scrambled deeper and deeper into the earth, far into the inky darkness of the thickest mycelial forest, where thick tendrils vied with web-like skeins. Unable to move any further, I lay on a bed of filaments, and curled myself into a ball. It swiftly ensnared me, a cocoon of protection wrapped around a heart of malice...
 
Now we are one. It acts, I act, we act. Sometimes it almost feels like I'm doing things against my will. It is terrifying, but I will grow used to it, even perhaps enjoy it.
 
Besides, I have real power now. And the first task is to learn if I wasn't the only survivor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMimics-Chapter2Objective">My new existence--a union of Mykara and Vaulter--is an unsettling one, but one that gives me power. Before I begin my quest for vengeance, I must interrogate those nearby to learn if others of my vault survived.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMimics-Chapter3Title">3. The Place Where They Fell</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMimics-Chapter3Description">I feel myself, my identity, slipping deeper into the Mykara's collective consciousness. It is a soothing, liberating, mind-expanding feeling, as my attention expands across the world and deeper into the past. But it is also a betrayal. I swore I would have vengeance, and I will not break that promise. I must not forget.
 
As the Mykara has changed me, so I have changed the Mykara. Out of my form, perhaps out of my very cells, it grows workers, builders, soldiers.
 
Some will be my instruments for my purposes. I will send an army back to our devastated home, and find the Mages' trail.
 
The site of our old vault--and the massacre--is hazy to me, but I must find it. During my slumber the Mykara moved me, and the geography of the world feels unfamiliar. It is hardly surprising that a Vaulter struggles to recognise the landscape; we've always been happier in the subterranean realm, more attuned to the vagaries of stone, the smell of the depths, and the shades of darkness that you learn from living underground.
 
Still, I have some ideas, and we will find the place. And if we are lucky, maybe we might even suprise a few Ardent Mages who've lingered too long...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMimics-Chapter3Objective">The only way to pick up the trail of the Mages is to revisit the site of the massacre, the place I once named home. My armies will need to search among a few candidate sites.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMimics-Chapter4Description">Calm, the Mykara whispers, but I am anything but calm. The growing symbiosis, the melding of my self into the Mykara collective, has been arrested as I find myself shaken to the very core. Did the Mykara save me or imprison me?
 
As my soldiers explored the ancient scene of the massacre, relaying their impressions through the mycelial web that stretches across Auriga, it was the small details that first alerted me to something being amiss. Flooded corridors and stagnant pools of water, lichen overgrowths and collapsed caverns, rusted machinery and scattered bones. Ironically, it wasn't until they came to the chamber of the great orrery, that the truth became impossible to deny. Despite the decay all around, the celestial mechanism had carried on working flawlessly, a testament to Vaulter engineering.
 
Auriga had circled its sun 284 times since the Mages' attack.
 
The Urkan beast commanded by the Mages would've returned to the depths. The Mage who was the architect of the slaughter would've died long ago. The same for their offspring. And their offspring's offspring, and onwards for who knows how many generations...
 
In that thought though, I found a tiny, devious, shard of hope. The Mages were a proud people, enraptured by their heritage, traditions--and history. A clan who committed such a famous victory--with an Urkan, no less!--would likely survive, even prosper, through the ages. The clan would be celebrated. Songs would be sung in their honor.
 
They wouldn't be hard to find. And so it was.
 
We will not have our revenge on those who committed the massacre. We will have our revenge on their descendants. They will pay for the sins of the ancestors, and they will have a new song to sing. Is there anything sweeter?
 
I war with the Mykara, but I still must avenge the Vaulter dead.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMimics-Chapter5Description">I still feel the Mykara's disapproval, but I also feel their acceptance. Every day our union grows stronger. My thoughts entangle with the collective's, such that I'm sometimes unsure where my mind ends and the Mykara's begins. Calmed, I follow threads of meditations deeper and deeper into the distant past. I witness that the Mykara and the Urkans have clashed many times over the ages. The cycle is always the same. The Urkans emerge from the heart of Auriga and wander the land, wrecking havoc on the fledgling cultures they encounter. Before they can strike a terminal blow though, the Mykara rise up from the depths and pacify the beasts.
 
For time immemorial, the Mykara have been the Urkans' keepers. And now the Urkans rise again, the Mykara rise likewise.
 
I wonder how many souls like myself have been merged into the collective over the millenia? Within the collective's memories I find no impression of such spirits--either I haven't reached deep enough into the Mykara's recollections, or the psyches of these individuals has blended so intimately that they've become untraceable. Will this be my fate too?
 
From that well, another thought springs. Observing from a vantage point that spans the ages, my own vendetta against the Mages feels...petty...inconsequential. With the Urkans breaking the crust and roaming the lands once again, I must focus my will on a greater matter than revenge. I will prepare a Mykara hero...</LocalizationPair>

My thoughts entangle with the collective's, such that I'm sometimes unsure where my mind ends and the Mykara's begins. Calmed, I follow threads of meditations deeper and deeper into the distant past. I witness that the Mykara and the Urkans have clashed many times over the ages. The cycle is always the same. The Urkans emerge from the heart of Auriga and wander the land, wrecking havoc on the fledgling cultures they encounter. Before they can strike a terminal blow though, the Mykara rise up from the depths and pacify the beasts.
 
For time immemorial, the Mykara have been the Urkans' keepers. And now the Urkans rise again, the Mykara rise likewise.
 
I wonder how many souls like myself have been merged into the collective over the millenia? Within the collective's memories I find no impression of such spirits--either I haven't reached deep enough into the Mykara's recollections, or the psyches of these individuals has blended so intimately that they've become untraceable. Will this be my fate too?
 
From that well, another thought springs. Observing from a vantage point that spans the ages, my own vendetta against the Mages feels...petty...inconsequential. With the Urkans likely to roam the lands once again, I must focus my will on a greater matter than revenge. I will prepare a Mykara hero...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMimics-Chapter5AltObjective">With the Urkans return imminent, it is time to work in harmony with the Mykara. Even if it weakens us, we must study the ancient tome and be ready for the great beasts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMimics-Chapter5AltOutcome">I hope our time spent studying the ways of the Urkans was not wasted. We have learned some of their weaknesses I just hope we can use that knowledge. Now I must better understand the balance that we seek, and be ready for the endless winter.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMimics-Chapter6Title">6. Voices of the Past</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMimics-Chapter6Description">Deep in my slumber, away from my corporeal perceptions, I hear them. A faint babble, not unlike the gentle susurration of waves on the shore. Listen more carefully though, and the murmur becomes more like a chorus of lullabies. They are the voices of children of Auriga, long assimilated into the Mykaran collective, and I am simply the most recent of their number. The youngest sibling.
 
I know not their names, and even though their bodily forms have no doubt enmeshed into the mycelial fabric to such a degree that identification would be impossible without instruments of science, I can feel their heritage. Among the refrain I detect a Drakken, Wild Walker, Sister of Mercy, Necrophage, even a Morgawr. No doubt there are others I cannot yet discern. I imagine they are in communion--conversing, pleading, persuading--a combined influence on the intentions of the Mykara who harbors them all.
 
They carry the history of their people, the history of Auriga.
 
The winter grows harsher every cycle. We must sharpen our weapons and weaken our enemies, so the Mykara--and all its voices--survive...</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMimics-Chapter7Description">In the long silences I begin to discern the voices of the others more clearly. They are singing, a rich tapestry of music composed of many threads, each telling a piece of Auriga's history. In my mind's eye I see glittering cities of chrome and glass lancing up to the heavens, citadel-like eyries on snowy peaks, a band of hunched survivors trekking a devastated wasteland, each a remembrance from the Mykaran collective. I feel the stream of visions is a conversation, but I still lack the insight to follow the nuances, and the images come to me unexpectedly, jumping between long-separated eras like the attentions of a capricious god.
 
I don't think those that were once Wild Walker or Morgawr or Endless or whoever retain much sense of their own identity, and I feel the same thing happening to myself. The deeper I dive into the Mykaran collective--the more closely I can follow the symphony--the further I feel from my old self. I was a...Vaulter. Yes, a Vaulter leader. Something terrible happened to my people, but I forget the reasons, and only remember the fear and terror. It doesn't matter. It's over now. I'm sure the collective remembers, anyway.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMimics-Chapter8Description">The endless winter comes, creating an icy tomb out of an entire world. Snows will lie a hundred hands deep. Oceans will freeze. Life will cease.

Well, if we are fortunate, not all life.

Some species seek refuges from time. Others grasp for the cold reaches of space. For ourselves, the Mykara, we will withdraw into the heart of the planet where molten fires battle against the encroaching ice.

We sing rich remembrances: vivid memories of biological horrors in Endless laboratories; their descendants eking out a life in irradiated wastelands; later, a slaughter of one Aurigan tribe by another in a subterranean citadel. Our melodic discourse speculates on science and philosophy, truth and justice, crime and punishment, but our first instinct is always to preserve. Whatever comes of Auriga, we will abide, ready to share its story.

Of the Urkans, we know not how they will survive the winter. Likely they will return to the depths as they have always done. Maybe the heat of the core will be enough to keep them alive. And if, in one distant day--decades, or centuries, or millenia hence, it doesn't matter--they emerge into an Aurigan spring, the Mykara will be ready.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMimics-Chapter8Objective">Soon, the winter will be unending. We must make our first city an engine of our survival, as we prepare to retreat deep into the sanctuary--and warmth--of the mantle.</LocalizationPair>

Our tales echo back through the ages, before the winters, before the blossoming of new races, before even the scarred and irradiated lands that the Endless wrought. Long, long ago, only the Urkans shared Auriga with us. We wonder what will become of the great beasts...
 
But we must not dwell on the past. We must look to the future--to the stars. We wonder what society we will forge, away from the loamy earth that has kept us safe all these millenia.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToWarAcknowledged_Mimics">You must feel rage indeed to switch so easily from #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# to #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceProposed_Mimics">Nothing grows in a #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#. Would you consider #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceSigned_Mimics">We agree that life flourishes better in times of #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceRefused_Mimics">You offer #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#, but it is a poisoned peace. We say no!</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged_Mimics">It does not feel natural to move so abruptly from #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# to an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#, but we accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationSigned_Mimics">#F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT# is insufficient for our needs; we must have an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged_Mimics">It is odd, your desire to create an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# by force.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifySigned_Mimics">Auriga is fortunate to have such inhabitants as you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifyAcknowledged_Mimics">We are thankful that you share our thoughts and attitudes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningSigned_Mimics">You are growing thorns, not crops. Be careful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningAcknowledged_Mimics">Do not attempt to subjugate or control us!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">With empires like ours, the future of Auriga seems better than it might have been.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">We focus our rage on common enemies, so we share common needs.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">Your empire and ours share friends. This is a hopeful sign.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">Our alliance is a source of strength and life. We hope it continues.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">We see that we have become neighbors; we hope you are symbiotic rather than parasitic.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">The very roots of our empire become weary of this war, and our rage lessens.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">Time heals all wounds and covers all scars; our previous war is barely a memory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">A cold war is not an invitation for acts of rage and violence. We hope you can contain yourselves in the future.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">We have absorbed your city. Do you not see that the war has gone long enough?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">Has the capture of a city sated your rage? Is it not time to recover, to grow?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">Your armies cover the ground like autumn leaves.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">Perhaps you should view us as a symbol, an aspiration of what an empire can become.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">Truly, your empire thrives and flourishes as no other.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">You have armies in my territory. Are they there to sow, or to reap?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">Your peaceful behavior promises growth and satisfaction.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">Our empires are two separate beings, pulled together by a common war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">We share friends, so perhaps we share a vision of survival and growth.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">Our common friend has joined our alliance; let us hope we all share common dreams and desires.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">You edge up against our territory. Please remain on your side of the fence.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">The rage of war saps our force and exhausts our strength. We tire of conflict.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">It is my hope that we can both view our previous conflicts as acts of passion, not as examples of long-term desires.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">Do not force our rage to boil over from cold war to a hot one.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">For our success and survival the capture of your city was a necessity.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">You have taken our citizens and pretended their city is part of your empire. We do not forget.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">Remember that if it comes to a test of strength, ours is overwhelming.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">We see that you wave your weapons and sing your songs. You are powerful, but we are wise.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">You set an example, and we would do well to develop as you have.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">Our territory may be bountiful, but that does not mean your troops should come and admire it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">We are indeed at peace, but your history makes us wonder if this is short-lived.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">We have a common enemy, which means there is another empire we dislike more than you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">See that you tend to our common friends better than you dealt with us!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">We now have a common ally, but I distrust your motives and methods.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">Your remorseless desire to expand begins to push against our territory. Curb yourself.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">I have seen the horrors of war for ages, but this is a case where we do not desire to put an end to them!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">Your actions in previous conflicts make us incapable of viewing you as reliable or harmonious.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">Your aggression make us writhe and goads us into anger!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">Yes, we have taken one of your cities. Doubtless it will thrive with us as it never could have with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">We are not surprised you have taken a city, as killing and theft appear to be your only skills.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">Your empire is a laughing stock; its roots wither and its leaves droop.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">As you grow stronger and more dangerous, you fill other empires with dread and hatred.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">The stink of your troops on our lands outweighs the worst of our compost piles.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskToDeclareWarProposed_Mimics">Join us and #F3EAD8#declare war#REVERT#! It is for the good of all, and of Auriga.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceNegotiationAskToDeclareWarProposed_Mimics">We would go beyond a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT#, and ask you to #F3EAD8#declare war#REVERT# on this threat to our survival.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceAskToDeclareWarProposed_Mimics">We have a valuable peace between us; let us turn our anger against our enemy and #F3EAD8#declare war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceNegotiationAskToDeclareWarProposed_Mimics">Peace would be a valuable step, but if we are to thrive you must #F3EAD8#declare war#REVERT# on our enemy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceAskToDeclareWarProposed_Mimics">Cold war has cold benefits. We ask that you join us in an alliance and #F3EAD8#declare war#REVERT# on our enemy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceAskToDeclareWarProposed_Mimics">Let the first seed of this new alliance be to #F3EAD8#declare war#REVERT# on this enemy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceAskToDeclareWarProposed_Mimics">Our shared alliance means shared growth and shared goals. We must ask that you share suffering as well, and #F3EAD8#declare war#REVERT# on our enemy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPillagedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">If your needs were great, there is no harm in your act of #F3EAD8#pillage#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPillagedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">Auriga is a small planet, and resources are not infinite. #F3EAD8#Pillage#REVERT# its riches at your peril.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPillagingFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">#F3EAD8#Pillage#REVERT# seems to be an ugly word, but if you are in need do not hesitate to harvest.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPillagingFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">You dare to harvest the riches of the entire planet as if it was yours? Cease your acts of #F3EAD8#pillage#REVERT# or be prepared to suffer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionSpySpottedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">You have sent #F3EAD8#spies#REVERT# to learn the ways of the Mykara? Your interest in our culture is fascinating.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionSpySpottedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">You overstep your territory with these #F3EAD8#spies#REVERT#. Control yourselves, and we will hold our anger in check.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionSpySpottedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">Your #F3EAD8#spies#REVERT# are not welcome! We are having difficulty restraining those who wish to see you punished.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPrisonerExchangeProposed_Mimics">Apparently we both hold prisoners; some over-curious travelers who studied each others lands. Shall we exchange them?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPrisonerExchangeSigned_Mimics">We are content to have our missing citizens home and safe.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPrisonerRecoveryProposed_Mimics">The tendrils of our empire that erred in your lands are an embarrassment. We ask that they be returned.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPrisonerRecoverySigned_Mimics">We are happy to see our people return home, and have no need to hold yours hostage.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOrbsStolenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">The Pearls incite growth, even in winter. We understand your interest!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOrbsStolenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">The Pearls are almost sacred to the ancient peoples of Auriga; be reasonable as you harvest.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOrbsStolenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">Your rapacious plundering of the Pearls cannot go on forever.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMantaAspiratingInMyTerritoryFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">Your Skyfin is a welcome sight in the skies above our filaments.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMantaAspiratingInMyTerritoryFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">Not all Mykara see the Skyfin as a good omen. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMantaAspiratingInMyTerritoryFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">To many filaments, your Skyfin is an interloper and a thief!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedEnemyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">By the grace of Auriga, you have #F3EAD8#eliminated our enemy#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedEnemyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">You did #F3EAD8#eliminate our enemy#REVERT#, but you removed our right to retribution.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedEnemyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">Why did you #F3EAD8#eliminate our enemy#REVERT#? The right to that vengeance was ours!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedAllyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">You #F3EAD8#eliminated one of our allies#REVERT#, but they were of little use to the Mykara.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedAllyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">Your anger is misplaced; you have #F3EAD8#eliminated an ally#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedAllyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">Your #F3EAD8#elimination of our ally#REVERT# is an act that demands retribution!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedFriendFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">You #F3EAD8#eliminated our friends#REVERT#. But they were not true friends of the Mykara.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedFriendFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">We seek to understand why you would #F3EAD8#eliminate our friend#REVERT#...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedFriendFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">In your violent rage you have #F3EAD8#eliminated our friend#REVERT#. Such madness must be stopped, and we will do it if we must.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedAcquaintanceFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">Filaments of the Mykara say that you have #F3EAD8#eliminated one of Auriga's races#REVERT#. We do not condemn these actions.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEliminatedAcquaintanceFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">You have #F3EAD8#slaughtered a mutual acquaintance#REVERT#. You incite the Mykara to rage and vengeance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCityTakenFromEnemyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">The Mykara has learned that you have #F3EAD8#taken our enemy's city#REVERT#. We are content; perhaps jealous!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCityTakenFromEnemyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">We see that you have #F3EAD8#taken our enemy's city#REVERT#. We hope your desire for conquest is now sated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCityTakenFromEnemyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">In your lust for violence you have #F3EAD8#taken our enemy's city#REVERT#. The Mykara does not approve.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCityTakenFromAllyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">You #F3EAD8#took an ally's city#REVERT#, but they are an ally in name only.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCityTakenFromAllyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">The Mykara sees that you #F3EAD8#took an ally's city#REVERT#. Little escapes our notice; be careful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCityTakenFromAllyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">You will unchain our rage for #F3EAD8#taking an ally's city#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCityTakenFromFriendFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">Sometimes even a friend needs a stern lesson; we do not mind the #F3EAD8#capture of their city#REVERT#. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCityTakenFromFriendFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">You #F3EAD8#took our friend's city#REVERT# without hesitation. Perhaps you will hesitate next time?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCityTakenFromFriendFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">We have seen the ruin of war for ages, and your #F3EAD8#capture of our friend's city#REVERT# angers us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAtWarWithMyAllyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">We assume that your #F3EAD8#war with our ally#REVERT# is a just one.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAtWarWithMyAllyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">Your #F3EAD8#war against our ally#REVERT# is an act of hatred and violence that we do not accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionBetrayedYourAllyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">Your #F3EAD8#betrayal of our ally#REVERT# seems odd, but it does not affect the Mykara.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionBetrayedYourAllyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">You #F3EAD8#betrayed one of our allies#REVERT#. The Mykara find that unpleasant, but will not seek revenge.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionBetrayedYourAllyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">Your #F3EAD8#betrayal of our ally#REVERT# says that soon you will be coming for the Mykara. Our rage begins to boil.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionBetrayedYourFriendFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">You #F3EAD8#betrayed our friend#REVERT#, but that may just make them appreciate the Mykara even more.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionBetrayedYourFriendFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">The news of your #F3EAD8#betrayal of our friend#REVERT# is unfortunate and unworthy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionBetrayedYourFriendFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">Your decision to #F3EAD8#betray our friend#REVERT# may have come lightly, but the consequences will be heavy!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDismantleDeviceSufferedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">We see you did not like our volcanoformation machine, and we are also glad to see it go.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDismantleDeviceSufferedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">You ruined a Mykara volcanoformation machine, but we do not feel a need for vengeance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDismantleDeviceSufferedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">Your desire for ruin extends to our volcanoformation machine! You seem to be a force of violence and evil.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTerraformedInMyTerritoryFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">The lands you have volcanoformed have a feel and flavor that we find pleasing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTerraformedInMyTerritoryFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">You should not volcanoform in our lands without permission! Be careful of your wanton ways.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTerraformedInMyTerritoryFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">You parch and salt our lands with your volcanoformation? This is theft and violence!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTerraformedNearMyArmiesFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">The hard, flat lands you are volcanoforming let our armies see enemies more easily.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTerraformedNearMyArmiesFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">Do you wish to cook Mykara armies with your volcanoforming? Be careful, that is not a toy.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">One of your Urkan frolics in a neighboring region; we hope that it is friendly and housebroken.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1">Your placement of an Urkan so close to us is almost an act of war!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">The Urkan was a means of self-defense, and it is unfortunate that you have deprived us of it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">You have destroyed our attempt to control an Urkan, and we do not appreciate that!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1">You would kill anything to have your way, even one of the Urkans of Aurgia!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">The Urkan was important to the Mykara, and we are sad that you felt forced to destroy it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">The Urkan was an extension of our Mykara nation, and your attack on it is not appreciated!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">Your reckless butchering of the Urkan will not be forgiven by the Mykara!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">You have led an Urkan into a region neighboring the Mykara; we hope it is only there for defensive reasons.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mimics">The Urkan you defeated was beginning to get expensive. The Mykara are not unhappy to see it go.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mimics">Our bond with the Urkan is an old one, and you have ruptured it. We hope you had good reason.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mimics">You would leave the Mykara defenseless by destroying our Urkan? You will drive us to rage and vengeance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_MadFairies">Your Fungal Bloom is fascinating, and we are curious to see what it will become.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_MadFairies">A Fungal Bloom is like a structure, and you should be more careful where you build it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_MadFairies">Your Fungal Bloom is an invasive and unwanted species!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_MadFairies">Your Urkan roams in a neighboring region; we will observe it with curiosity.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_MadFairies">We see your Urkan nearby, and wonder if it there as a threat...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_MadFairies">If you attack us with this Urkan on our border, you will learn the meaning of rage...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_MadFairies">The Urkan was as strange as it was powerful, and we are not unhappy to no longer have to care for it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_MadFairies">You meddle in the affairs of our empire when you attack our Urkan. Be careful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_MadFairies">Your butchery of the Urkan is an unpardonable offense!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Vaulters">We survived many years in the caves on mushrooms, so your Fungal Bloom intrigues us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Vaulters">Though we share your curiosity of the Fungal Bloom, we are not happy about your placement of it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Vaulters">Your Fungal Bloom brings back unpleasant memories, and we would like you to remove it!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Vaulters">Your Urkan is a strange as it is fascinating; we are content to regard it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Vaulters">We do not fear beasts or war; if you move your Urkan towards us you will learn this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Vaulters">We view your nearby Urkan as a means to an invasion, and will react accordingly!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Vaulters">We are not happy that you destroyed our Urkan, but it was a very expensive experiment.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Vaulters">We can no longer learn of the Urkans since you destroyed ours; that is a loss to our science.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Vaulters">Your desire to kill and destroy has deprived us of our Urkan!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Necrophages">Your Fungal Bloom is fascinating, as we are always interested in new sources of food.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Necrophages">If your Fungal Bloom is an offensive weapon, we will react exactly as you expect.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Necrophages">Remove your Fungal Bloom. We do not want it so near.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Necrophages">This Urkan you have let loose next to us is stranger and uglier than we are. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Necrophages">Your Urkan is large and impressive. Make sure that it is also distant.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Necrophages">We are watching your Urkan, with sharp knives and empty bellies, waiting for an excuse...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Necrophages">The Urkan required too much food and was difficult to control; we will not miss it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Necrophages">If the Urkan was to be killed, it should have been killed by us. You meddle.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Necrophages">You have destroyed our Urkan; the Hive's hunger and anger turn toward you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RageWizards">We are curious to see what substances come from your nearby Fungal Bloom.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RageWizards">Your Fungal Bloom seems strange to us; we shall eye it closely.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RageWizards">We do not like your Fungal Bloom near our territory; remove it unless you wish to suffer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RageWizards">We are curious to learn more of the Urkan you have placed near our lands .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RageWizards">Your Urkan is both a distraction and a threat; we are not happy to see it so near.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RageWizards">If you leave your Urkan so close to us, we shall begin inventing an agonizing penance for you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RageWizards">The Urkan was too much of a brute and blunt instrument; its loss does not bother us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RageWizards">We would have liked to learn more of the limits of the Urkan; why did you destroy it?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RageWizards">The Urkan was ours to drive mad with penance, not yours to kill!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RovingClans">The Fungal Bloom that has blossomed near us looks interesting... and profitable?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RovingClans">As long as your Fungal Bloom does not interfere with trade, we will not spoil it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RovingClans">The stench of your Fungal Bloom drives customers away! Remove it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RovingClans">It is most amusing to watch the Urkan you have placed near us. We may sell tickets to viewings.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RovingClans">Something as dangerous as an Urkan, so close to us, risks having a bad effect on business...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RovingClans">Did you place your Urkan to scare off business and cut off trade? It is unacceptable!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_RovingClans">The clans were tiring of the noise and smell of the Urkan; we will not miss it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_RovingClans">The Urkan was an expensive investment! We would rather you had not destroyed it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_RovingClans">How dare you destroy that Urkan? These beasts are rare, and you have made us lose Dust!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Drakkens">We shall study your Fungal Bloom with curiosity and an open mind.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Drakkens">We are not entirely happy with your Fungal Bloom, but will let it be.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Drakkens">Your Fungal Bloom so close to us upsets the balance! It must go.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Drakkens">The Urkan is one of Auriga's creatures, so we are content to study and observe it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Drakkens">The Urkan near our borders is a thing of great power. To be honest, it makes us uneasy...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Drakkens">You pressure our borders with a monstrous Urkan! This situation cannot be allowed to last.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Drakkens">It is sad to see a creature die, even a monstrous Urkan, but the end comes to all things.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Drakkens">Your willingness to destroy our Urkan upsets the equilibrium of Auriga; we are not happy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Drakkens">Killing an Urkan is a terrible act upon a noble creature! How will you recompense us?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Queen has noted your Fungal Bloom nearby, and is curious. Be happy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Eternal End watches all things, and is concerned about your Fungal Bloom.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Unspoken hates your Fungal Bloom; it may be the end of you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Cultists">We watch your Urkan nearby, and wonder what purpose it serves in the plans of the Queen.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Cultists">We see your Urkan near us; be careful that it does not enrage the Unspoken.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Cultists">You try to goad us to fear with your Urkan! The Cult knows no fear, and no pity.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Cultists">Our Urkan is gone. Apparently, it was not part of the greater design intended by the Queen.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Cultists">The Urkan was a symbol of the power of the Eternal End! How dare your terminate it!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Cultists">As you destroyed the Urkan that had the Queen's favor, it is expected that we destroy you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mezari">We see your nearby Fungal Bloom. It's weird, but interesting.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mezari">That Fungal Bloom you're pushing up won't cause trouble, will it? Hmmm...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mezari">I don't like the look of your Fungal Bloom, and I don't want it around any more.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mezari">That Urkan is one big, ugly mug. Fun to watch, even though it is very close.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mezari">We look at that Urkan every day, and wonder why you put it right next to us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mezari">Putting that Urkan next door means you want trouble. We can provide plenty of that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Mezari">Did you really have to kill our Urkan? Well, maybe you did.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Mezari">You should not have killed our Urkan. Those things are a pain to get control of.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Mezari">Killing our Urkan was pretty much an act of war. Is that really what you want?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Replicants">Even a blind person would notice your Fungal Bloom nearby. And we are not blind.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Replicants">Your Fungal Bloom is a reason for concern. It makes us uneasy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Replicants">Our blades are ready and we are wondering: Should we harvest you, or your Fungal Bloom?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Replicants">We learn much by watching your Urkan that is near us. We will continue to do so.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Replicants">The Forgotten are uneasy with your giant Urkan so close to us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Replicants">To bring an Urkan so close means that you wish to use it against us. Do we prepare for war?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Replicants">It was a strange, dangerous, and ugly thing, the Urkan. Still, we will miss it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Replicants">Our Urkan is dead at your hands. We will not riposte, but we are not happy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Replicants">When you kill our Urkan, it is like killing one of our children. Imagine how we feel about that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_WinterShifters">Your nearby Fungal Bloom is yet another of the many strange and wonderful things upon Auriga.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_WinterShifters">Though your Fungal Bloom is a natural growth of Auriga, its location concerns us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_WinterShifters">Your Fungal Bloom is like a spy or invasion beachhead! If it stays, we will react.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_WinterShifters">Perhaps the greatest and weirdest of Auriga's creatures is your Urkan; it amuses us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_WinterShifters">The placement of your Urkan is a matter of concern. You will make us wary of you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_WinterShifters">We must assume that the Urkan next to us is there for conquest!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_WinterShifters">We are sad to see a creature of Auriga die. The Urkan, however, will not be missed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_WinterShifters">You kill a bit too easily; we would have preferred to keep our Urkan.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_WinterShifters">By destroying our Urkan you attack us directly! We shall ponder our retaliation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_SeaDemons">Your strange Fungal Bloom near our lands does not worry us. Its strangeness fascinates.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_SeaDemons">We trust others very little, and the Fungal Bloom nearby does not help.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_SeaDemons">You place a Fungal Bloom as a prelude to attack. This is obvious.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_SeaDemons">We admire your Urkan; keep it close, where we can track it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_SeaDemons">We see your Urkan--all of us--and we will react if it does anything foolish.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_SeaDemons">We see your Urkan, and also see that it is a means to attack and control us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_SeaDemons">Must you destroy our Urkan? The lonely, angry beast was almost like kin to us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_SeaDemons">The control of other beings is our shield, and we no longer control the Urkan you destroyed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_SeaDemons">Our Urkan was useful. You have destroyed it as a prelude to attack. We sense your contempt and hatred.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">Another strange wonder of Auriga, this Fungal Bloom you have placed near us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">We regard your Fungal Bloom as another dangerous alien species.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCreepingNodePlacedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">We do not like your Fungal Bloom, nor you. It must be purified with flame.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">Your Urkan amuses itself near our lands; perhaps it will like the taste of ash and lava?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">We expect you will not use your Urkan against us. But it is close, and we are uneasy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuPlacedNearMyCityFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">Our shamans will see your Urkan die in flames if you leave it so close to us!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1_Flames">You have deprived us of our Urkan. It was a violent beast, and we do not miss it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1_Flames">You decided to destroy our Urkan. We wonder where your urge to destroy leads you next.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionKaijuAttackedFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1_Flames">There is no excuse for the destruction of our Urkan! We will see that the fires punish you.</LocalizationPair>
