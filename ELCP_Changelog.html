<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Multiplayer saves from older versions are not compatible with newer versions (Singleplayer saves are fine)</p>
<h3>Changelog for v2.3.3:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ports the Community patch to Endless Legend v1.7.4 S3</li>
</ul>
<p><em>General</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an ELCP bug that could lead to AI battles locking up when modding tools where enabled</li>
<li>Introduced a workaround for games failing to load ("object reference not set to an instance of an object") due to trade routes of razed cities not being deleted correctly</li>
<li>When loading a save, the game now also checks, if there any converted villages of dead cultist players left and "fixes" them if necessary
<ul>
<li>This workaround was added to adress a rare issue of converted cultist villages not being "freed" correctly, when the converting empire is eliminated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed some more instances of stuttering caused by the AI being unable to generate a path to its intended target</li>
<li>Fixed Vaulter Holy Resource Booster preventing Urkan Resource gain and AI difficulty bonus of that resource to work</li>
<li>Less Nudism: Nidya Arpuja mercenaries now wear torso and head armor pieces corresponding to the current era</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Urkans would only be able to embark if they where in army form when shipyard research finished</li>
<li>Improved lategame AI performance slightly</li>
<li>Streamlined ELCP's new trade route calculation a bit, Frozen Water tiles will no longer be considered for roads</li>
<li>Fixed the randomization aspect of "Dust Opportunist" not working correctly, also changed the equation a bit</li>
</ul>
<p><em>UI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed fungal bloomed Villages not displaying their Assimilation Bonus in the tooltip</li>
<li>The tooltip for the Infiltration-Action "Dust Opportunist" now displays how much dust will be stolen when using the action (lower and upper limit)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Balance [Core]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Due to popular demand, there is now a pre-game setting that lets you disable the ELCP-rule-change on how blackspot works
<ul>
<li>With the Vanilla-Blackspot-Ruleset enabled, you can again conquer cities and fortresses of blackspotted enemies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Balance [XML]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Increased the amount of dust stolen by "Dust Opportunist" by roughly one level</li>
<li>Soul Burn (Broken Lords eclipse ability) now causes 5% of max hp damage per turn (down from 10%)</li>
<li>The "Ward of the Cocoon"-Shield now grants "Natural Immunity" (immunity against most debuffs and stuns except overtime-damage)
<ul>
<li>The quest granting this shield is rarely completed due to it requiring the sacrifice of a settler, which is typically considered too much of a price for a slightly better early game shield</li>
<li>Giving the shield an additional rare capacity should make it a bit more enticing. "Natural Immunity" also allows it to be combod with Ceratan Driders, thus matching the lore of the quest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The "Better Friends Than Enemies" competitive quest now rewards strategic instead of luxury resources
<ul>
<li>The completion of this quest is mostly down to luck and the luxury reward can lead to some nasty snowballing (getting an early Urkan and/or the Wealth Harvester deed)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rebalanced some neutral units with the intention of weakening the overused ones a bit while improving the weaker ones.
<ul>
<li>Jotus Tetike now have true sight. These neutral units are quite expensive, and neither their passive bonus nor their battle prowess justifies this. True sights fits their theme and gives them a more distinct role.</li>
<li>Increased base damage of Ceratan Driders by 10. While the passive effect of these unit is fine, their stats in general are bad (as are those of most support units), and the weak heal is typically not worth using due to the stun effect it entails.</li>
<li>Reduced the base damage of Dorgeshi Burdeki by 14 and increased their base production cost by 33%. Dorgeshi are one of the better Assimilations due to their good passive effect, and their cheap but highly effective unit. This change is intended to make the Burdeki more of a "support stunner" and less of a damage dealer.</li>
<li>Urces Rumblers lose their Beam capacity, can now wear 2h Axes instead of Claws, and have their base cost reduced by 10. Urces are one of the most used Units dues to their strong passive and them being cheap, well statted tanks. In particular they outshine the very(!) similar but more expensive Silics Harmonite in most situations. This change should give it a more distinct role as cheap, sturdy infantry without any extras.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reverted the general 50% Increase to Cat's Paw influence cost that ELCP introduced a few patches ago, instead only Fomorian armies are now 50% more expensive to mind control
<ul>
<li>While the Morgawr remain one of the stronger factions, there have been complaints that the old nerf makes the use of (landbased) Cat's Paw in general not feasable</li>
<li>As a compromise I opted for a more targeted approach, mind controlling fomorians (one but not the only source of the Morgawr's guaranteed early ocean dominance) is still more expensive, while mind controlling land based armies is back to its original influence cost</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduced the food gain of all volcanic tiles by 1
<ul>
<li>Since their introduction the Kapaku have been an unholy combination of easy to play and very(!) strong , mainly because of their many strengths (5 base FISDI on preferred terrain instead of the usual 3, good Science and Industry, one of the best Era 2 units) in combination with no real weakness that matters, as volcano formation is cheap early on, and they tend to have more strategics anyway</li>
<li>With this change, their base FISDI is reduced by 1, the intention is to make food gain their weakness and their early game slower when compared to other factions</li>
<li>As a side benefit, the effectiveness of volcanic terrain for other factions is unchanged</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduced the number of Regions required for an expansion victory slightly</li>
<li>Slavery no longer works with Converted Villages</li>
<li>Gave Urkans Disease Immunity in order to make Necrophages less lopsidedly strong against them</li>
<li>Taming Urkans now always requires at least Era 3 Luxuries, and the amount needed is now fixed at 30 (+ 20 for each other Urkan under control of the instigating empire)</li>
<li>Scythers now have the "Urkan Slayer 2" Capacity, The Guardian "Atmos" now has the "Urkan Slayer 3" Capacity
<ul>
<li>Both units are expensive and rarily seen, with the Introduction of the new and very strong Urkans these can now serve as alternative ways to counter them</li>
<li>Atmos in particular lacked a specialized combat role and was rarily seen for that reason</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expansion Disapproval reducing Technologies are no longer available for Mykara</li>
<li>Overgrown Cities no longer generate Expansion Disapproval as soon as Symbiosis is complete</li>
<li>Overgrown Cities have their happiness fixed at 80 as soon as Symbiosis is complete (they still only have 60 otherwise)</li>
<li>Overgrown Cities have their Empire Scale factor reduced by 50% (that means their impact on Empire plans as well as some Boosters like Luxuries is halved when compared to normal cities, thanks Cornebre)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>AI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Heavily reworked the AI's management of Urkans
<ul>
<li>Updated ELCP's reworked trading AI, so it takes the Urkans Luxury needs into account. AIs should be more likely to peacefully tame and train them.</li>
<li>AI's can now uproot Urkans and use their army form, if they deem it to be necessary.</li>
<li>They will also use the teleport/resettle ability offensively</li>
<li>AI's are smarter about choosing the actual settling position of Urkans</li>
<li>Furthermore AI's no longer "cheat" when using resettle, that means they can't ignore the AP or cooldown requirements. They also don't resettle while the Urkan is in army form.</li>
<li>This is just a first step, this new AI will probably need more work in the future</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reworked how AIs try to engage Urkans, they should be less inclined to just waste armies on them, attacks should be more coordinated</li>
<li>When at war, AIs will be unlikely to send forces away to tame an Urkan that is no immediate threat</li>
<li>Fixed AIs trying to settle regions occupied by Urkans</li>
<li>The AI now makes usage of the Atmos' teleport ability</li>
<li>Mykara-AIs are now able to use fast travel via overgrown ruins</li>
<li>Fixed an instance where Forgotten-AIs would still assign infinite value to a technology trade (thanks TrueValhalla)</li>
<li>Mykara will now research resource technologies even if no deposit is in their main region</li>
<li>Added the missing AI skill weights for Mykara heros and the Haunts hero</li>
<li>Broken lords will no longer assimilate Bos, Forgotten will no longer assimilate Haunts</li>
<li>Broken Lords will try to avoid using food based governors, Forgotten science based ones respectively, improved governor skill builds of both factions aswell</li>
<li>Some minor tweaks to colonization behavior</li>
<li>Improved pacification AI
<ul>
<li>AIs below hard difficulty sometimes had trouble pacifying their regions which in turn let to no colonization attempts and small empires</li>
<li>The changes made should improve lower difficulty AIs expansion behavior and should also improve their ability to deal with "hard"-difficulty minor factions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AI Heros will now use additional accessory slots gained by skills</li>
<li>Introduced a new pre-game option "Shackle AI". Use this option to "put the AI in shackles", resulting in it having a soft cap on how many units it can produce depending on its empire size
<ul>
<li>This option is mainly intended to be used by players that deactivate most victory conditions</li>
<li>In very long games (due to missing victory conditions) an AI may otherwise snowball and continue producing absurd amounts of units which can tank the performance to permanent single-digit fps</li>
<li>Note: this will naturally reduce the lategame challenge an AI can pose</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Modding</em></p>
<ul>
<li>With modding tools enabled, selecting a technology in the Research Screen while pressing the "G"-Key instantly unlocks that technology</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changelog for v2.3.0:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ports the Community patch to Endless Legend v1.7.2 S3 - Symbiosis!</li>
</ul>
<p><em>General</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Armies can no longer teleport to cities that are in an ongoing battle zone
<ul>
<li>Doing this let to weird behavior like world armies standing around in the battle zone which could be confusing for battling players</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed a longstanding issue, that would lead to no quest armies spawning in step 3 of the alternative Chapter 2 Faction Quest for vaulters and Mezari rendering the quest unsolvable</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented armies from entering or leaving camps, when its main city is besieged</li>
<li>Fixed some bugs of the (oceanic) trade route calculation
<ul>
<li>The pathfinding for oceanic trade routes is now "smarter" and more reliable; It will try to avoid enemy regions which often prevented routes that should work from establishing</li>
<li>Oceanic trade routes are now recalculated every turn to account for region ownership changes and effects like ice shelves (thanks Robin Claassen)</li>
<li>Roads are now recalculated on season change and on reload for similar reasons</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dust, Science and Influence Modifiers of the ELCP-"Handicap" setting are now applied on an empire level, not on a city level</li>
<li>Improved lategame-stuttering that occured when a city battle was active</li>
<li>Improved stuttering that could occur, if an AI wants to explore or colonize a region but parts of it are unreachable</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where AI-Battles could lock up forever because when reinforcements without standard units where in play (thanks VoidInsanity)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the mac version did not properly load ELCPs custom module override, leading to a bunch of issues like not being able to join other elcp hosts through ingame browser, weird AI behavior, etc. (thanks Robin Claassen)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>UI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Stockpiles can now be used directly from the City List Screen and the City Info Panel (new UI elements can be found in the FISDI-Panel)
<ul>
<li>This is the first time I basically added an UI-Element from scratch (without using hidden leftover prefabs made by Amplitude). Since all of it is done in code, bugs may occur. If you find something reproducable, message me!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also gave Cadavre and Rubble Stockpiles a color (slightly different in comparison to normal Food/Industry Stockpiles)</li>
<li>Technologies the AI is not interested in are now marked red in the Negotiation Screen</li>
<li>The "apply unused army movement"-button now queues up the order when it is used during the transition between two turns
<ul>
<li>You no longer have to spam click that button to immediatly send out movement orders at the start of the next turn, one click is enough</li>
<li>Only works when the button is active/reactivated (that means: not greyed out)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Balance [Core]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>When using the ELCP-Fortification Ruleset, cities and Armies located on them will now always take part in the battle, if a battle counts as a city battle
<ul>
<li>Under the Vanilla-Ruleset, besieged cities, that are in the enemy's deployment zone get removed from the battle (their tiles and their reinforcements)</li>
<li>I changed it because the rule is confusing, undocumented, and bad for the Defender</li>
<li>Note: Besieged Cities in the enemy deployment zone will still be removed, if the battle is not a city battle (i.e. none of the main contenders are on an exploitation tile)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Balance [XML]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Increased the diplomatic point gain of Peace (to 3) and Alliances (to 7)
<ul>
<li>The rework of the diplomatic Victory in 2.2.2 was succesfull in neutering the explosive nature of that victory condition</li>
<li>This change is intended to further "nudge" that playstyle towards general peacefullness instead of spamming trades, Diplomatic Victory also was a bit too hard to achieve otherwise</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Victory Alert for the quest Victory now only triggers after the first step (visiting a ruin with a suitable army) has been completed
<ul>
<li>Also removed the warning after completing the second step, since it occurs shortly after the (now) first warning and is rather redundant</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All Guardians except Neros have received the Flamewalker Ability (immunity to Lava rivers)</li>
<li>Reduced Helm of the Urkans Health Gain from 900 to 90 since I have the strong suspition the former was a typo</li>
<li>Improved Flamewalker Stats so they are comparable with era 3.5 strategic equipment
<ul>
<li>Flamewalkers are in a weird spot right now, while lava rivers are annoying, experienced players usually dont trade away raw stats for convenience</li>
<li>This should also make researching the necessary tech a bit more enticing, which is currently very niche anyway</li>
<li>Additionally it will help AIs that rely on them to not burn their units, since reworking the AI pathfinding in a way that it intelligently avoids lava tiles while not shooting itself in the foot in certain situations is beyond my capabilities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Increased the Dust gain of the Broken Lords' Founder Memorial to 10 (same as Forgotten) in order to boost their early game economy a bit</li>
</ul>
<p><em>AI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>AIs will value Flamewalkers higher for units that have no innate lava immunity</li>
<li>Adressed an issue where AIs that try to dispose Fungal Blooms sometimes stand around and do nothing</li>
<li>Prevented AIs from trying to tame Urkans that they can not reach (due to missing ship tech or closed borders) which led to armies assigned to that task standing around with no purpose</li>
<li>AICommanders responsible for taming Urkans will now benefit from ELCP's grouping AI</li>
<li>AIs will now always try to activate Siege Mode before attacking a city (to prevent defenders from stalling by spamming retreat)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where AIs would try to attack their own Armies when under the influence of blackspot, which predictably failed and could led to the AI locking up</li>
<li>Improved Camp defense behavior, the AI will not be so overzealous when it comes to defending camps</li>
<li>AIs no longer receive their difficulty related production cost bonus when building the Temple of the Earth's Core (Victory building)
<ul>
<li>The free production cost reduction AIs gain on higher difficulties could lead do very fast, impossible to stop victories on higher difficulties</li>
<li>In turn improved the AIs evaluation for industry stockpiles once more, so they will prioritize using them on wonders</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guardians are now heavily prioritized when the AI reevaluates its unit designs
<ul>
<li>Previously they where often naked or had few items allthough the AI could afford more, because it treated them just like any other unit design</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also improved AI-Guardian usage: Skoros can use his heal ability now (also on allies!), Gios will no longer guard cities that are not endangered</li>
<li>Improved AI Fleet behavior
<ul>
<li>AI Fleets are more likely to leave a fortress, if a weak enemy army is nearby</li>
<li>AI Fleets can now dynamically attack opportunity targets, that are not their main target (should make them more responsive)</li>
<li>AI Fleets will be better at respecting vision restrictions (Camouflage, Fog) when deciding what to attack, so they no longer follow your yellow bathysphere around the globe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved Hero skill builds once again
<ul>
<li>Also fixed a bug that would prevent AIs from learning the "Inspirational Leader" Governor skill, when the player has purchased the "Shadows"-DLC</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AIs will now alter their behavior and reactions depending on how much they like another empire
<ul>
<li>Note: "Like" refers to the opinion the AI has of another empire, not the relation state - An AI may hate you even if you are at peace with it, and it may like you even if you are at cold war</li>
<li>Example: If AI A likes empire B:</li>
<li>A will no longer attempt to pillage buildings, Fungal Blooms or attack armies of B during cold war</li>
<li>A will not try to steal pearls from B's territory (it may still collect them by accident)</li>
<li>A will avoid hostile infiltration actions towards B</li>
<li>A will not react negatively to pearls taken in neutral territory by B</li>
<li>A will not react negatively to armies of B within A's borders</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AIs will respect invisibility when it comes to stolen orbs and will no longer be angry if they cant see the army doing the deed</li>
<li>Friendly AIs will no longer be mad at you for declining to join a war against an enemy they are significantly superior to anyway</li>
<li>Fixed some bugs in the AIs success projection of city battles</li>
<li>Improved city defense behavior in general, AIs are more likely to wait for reinforcements instead of attacking immediatly</li>
<li>Raised Morgawrs willingness to use dissent</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Roving clans would give away market ban removal for free</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Modding</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an ELCP issue where capacities would not display for (modded) hero classes that have no innate abilities (thanks Cornebre)</li>
<li>The Unitdesign Debugger now displays skill weights</li>
<li>The Infiltration Debugger now displays decision weights</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changelog for v2.2.3:</h3>
<p><em>General</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a Vanilla Bug where in games without eclipse (disabled or no Inferno DLC) the orb cost for prayers wouldn't reset correctly at the start of summer</li>
<li>Also fixed the tooltip displayed for prayer costs, since it displayed wrong, nonsensical values based on an outdated formula</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where under specific circumstances a city battle was not recognized as such, resulting in missing Fortification-Armor (thanks SB)</li>
<li>AIs will no longer insist on trying to upgrade each of its armies when all human players are ready, this should speed up lategame turn times considerably (thanks SB)</li>
<li>When generating a path the game will no longer let ships path through district tiles
<ul>
<li>This mainly helps the AI, since they arent able to manually "path around" obstacles, which sometimes led to AI fleets being trapped in gulfs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When attacking a city that has defending armies on it, the strongest army will now always be chosen as the main defender
<ul>
<li>Previously the main defender was more or less chosen at random</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a fallback for mod compatibility issues that would lead to heros and mercenaries costing 0 dust</li>
<li>Fixed a minor v1.6.10 issue, where elimination logos werent displayed correctly in some instances</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Balance [XML]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced the production and resource cost of the following colossi: Dust, Fire, Air
<ul>
<li>While both of the AoE capable colossi are in a good place, the other ones are rarily seen due to the opportunity costs in tech and their steep price</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>AI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>AIs can now focus on a Victory condition
<ul>
<li>Currently Tech, Economy, Diplomacy and Military conditions are supported</li>
<li>Focus depends on the personality of an AI and how strong the AI currently perceives itself to be in that area</li>
<li>Once a focus is chosen, AI behavior may change (for example a Military Focus leads to more war declarations, Diplomacy Focus to the opposite)</li>
<li>Takes the game settings into account (so no Tech Focus without Tech Victory being enabled)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AIs will no longer readily accept any gifted tech willingly, and may even reject techs outright depending on the circumstances</li>
<li>Victory Warnings no longer lower allied AIs Attitude if Shared Victory is enabled</li>
<li>AIs will no longer react negatively to another player stealing pearls, if they cant actually see the pearl
<ul>
<li>Note: Empires that can see pearls in the Fog due to having access to the "Orb Hunter" trait may still react negatively if you do it too often</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Additionally the Attitude hit due to the player "stealing" pearls in neutral territory near an AI's army got reduced by 50%</li>
<li>AIs can now offer prisoner deals on their own
<ul>
<li>Also made the evaluation of prisoner deals a bit more reasonable (they want less for releasing them, and value releasing their own prisoners higher)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Forgotten Heroes will now try to equip two different one handed weapons</li>
<li>Fixed an issue, that would lead to Skyfins idling around instead of collecting pearls and exploring</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Modding</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The Research and Negotiation Debuggers now display AI decision weights</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changelog for v2.2.2:</h3>
<p><em>General</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug of ELCP, that lead to faction specific traits being rendered useless until restart, when hovering over "demanding gods" in the faction creation screen (thanks Mindful!)</li>
<li>Fixed an Issue of the Mac Version locking up when entering the "Join Game"-Screen (hopefully, thanks Robin Claassen)</li>
<li>Quests that require a region to be "secure" now ignore naval Units by default
<ul>
<li>A number of issues could cause quests to be harder to solve than intended (like the Sea Monster blocking the quest because it likes to watch the beach)</li>
<li>Modders can use the new property IncludeNaval="true", if they want to reactivate the old behavior of ConditionCheck_RegionContainsEnemy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Victory status for the Wonder Victory will now display, how far an Empire is in its construction of the "Temple of the Earth's Core"</li>
<li>Added a new Advanced World Setting "Volcanize Kapaku Regions" - Ensures that starting regions of Kapaku players are volcanic
<ul>
<li>Is active by default and can be deactivated in the Advanced World Setting pregame menu</li>
<li>In Vanilla Kapaku player occasionally spawned in non-volcanic regions (especially when several of them where present)</li>
<li>With this option activated, if no suitable region is found, the next best region gets transformed into a volcanic one</li>
<li>Can be combined with setting "Volcanic Regions" to "None", which results in no volcanic regions except the Kapaku starting ones</li>
<li>Is inactive without the Inferno DLC</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>UI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Hero level up notifications now close automatically, if the heros' skill points have already been spent (similar to how booster notifications work)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Balance [Core]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>ELCP's progressive tech trade cost now incorporate a small exponential factor
<ul>
<li>That means players doing many tech trades will suffer a growing penalty in tech trade costs, while players that only occasionally trade techs while notice little difference</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a new ruleset for how Diplomatic Points from treaties accumulate (Idea by Gleb Strelets, programming help by Cornebre)
<ul>
<li>Is active by default and can be deactivated in the pregame menu</li>
<li>Instead of immediatly gaining Diplomatic Points from treaties, they are now stored in a buffer instead</li>
<li>Each turn a fixed amount of Diplomatic Points are transferred from this buffer onto the players Account</li>
<li>This effectively makes "from 0 to 100" Diplomatic Victories impossible</li>
<li>The default transfer-limit per turn is 30, it is influenced by game speed and map size</li>
<li>It can also be altered by the "Diplomatic Point Gain"-Multiplier (United Empires Council Tech, Winter effects)</li>
<li>Buffer and transfered amount are displayed in a new info panel in the lower left of the diplomacy screen</li>
<li>Note: Diplomatic points gained from relations are unaffected by this change</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Balance [XML]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced Diplomatic Points gained via diplomatic treaties from 0.1 to 0.05 per influence point spent
<ul>
<li>On default settings sub-turn-100-victories are still very much possible, this change makes treaties less dominant and increases the need of Alliances</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Increased the required base amount for the Economic Victory from 666600 to 777000</li>
<li>Reduced the World Size scaling of Economic and Diplomatic Victories from 1.4/1.8 for Large/Huge worlds to 1.3/1.6
<ul>
<li>The scaling for larger World Sizes felt "right", while the the amounts needed on normal map sizes was rather easy to achieve</li>
<li>Accordingly the base difficulty to reach these Victories got increased, but the scaling with map size got reduced</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Victory warnings for Economic, Technology and Diplomatic Victories are displayed a bit earlier</li>
<li>Increased the Influence cost of "Catspaw" by 50%
<ul>
<li>Catspawing naval armies is one of the main reasons, morgawr tend to spiral out of control early on</li>
<li>Increasing the influence cost should force morgawr players to commit more influence gathering if they want to pursue this route</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduced the FIDSI gain of oceanic facilities across the board (more so for the stronger ones)
<ul>
<li>Most Facilities are strong on their own and very cost effective (netting the player resources, stockpiles, buffs, and even weakining other players)</li>
<li>The reduced FIDSI gain should lower the impact of a (lucky) early sea grab)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Significantly reduced the effects of the following Facilities: Luxury Boost Facility, Strategic Boost Facility, Component Design Facility, Cargo Nexus Facility</li>
<li>Mercenary Corps/Freelance Guards now also reduce the Buyout cost of Mercenaries and Heros by 20%
<ul>
<li>This feature is mostly overlooked, mainly because mercenaries are too expensive in the important midgame portion of the game.</li>
<li>The added bonuses makes the tech a bit more lucrative, even if you dont plan to use it immediatly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>AI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A new AI-Layer teaches the AI a stronger focus on Victory conditions
<ul>
<li>AIs will react strongly to Victory warnings of other players (will take Difficulty and Allied Victory settings into account)</li>
<li>AIs will consider pursuing a science victory earlier</li>
<li>AIs can now actually solve the victory quest (without cheating!)</li>
<li>This new Layer is still experimental, further improvements may come in future updates</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AIs can now group up armies
<ul>
<li>Previously AI armies mostly acted independent of each other</li>
<li>A bunch of new function have been implemented in order to teach the AI the value of "army balls"</li>
<li>New preemptive city defense behavior hopefully makes the AI a bit better at defending its cities during war times</li>
<li>Is still experimental, report strange behavior</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reworked the way AIs use the resource section of the market place
<ul>
<li>Previously buying and selling resources was calculated independently, which could lead to the AI buying and selling the same resources in the same turn</li>
<li>In general the AI was to "sell happy", selling everything they cant use RIGHT now and flooding the market with resources</li>
<li>The reworked AI will be way less likely to do that, but will be more likely to buy out resources (especially luxuries) they can use</li>
<li>As a consequence the market place will be less "crowded" with goods</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AIs will now consider engaging in proactive resource and/or technology trades with friends</li>
<li>Tried fixing the Settler Spam bug .... again and again</li>
<li>AIs will now consider creating unitless Armies with heros they have no other usage for</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with the new WarResponse function that sometimes led Empires to show "irrational" behavior like declaring wars on Allies as a reaction to another Empire declaring war on them</li>
<li>AIs are less likely to irrationally abandon alliances and peacy treaties in times of need (when they are losing a war for example)</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented naval armies from being able to use bombardement</li>
<li>Loosened the range requirement for navy tasks in order to prevent naval AI armies from being jobless</li>
<li>AIs recognize now when a city is unsiegable (due to it having no unoccupied exploitation tiles around) and will look for better targets accordingly</li>
<li>Added a helper function that helps the AI to more efficiently regroup large army balls, since the generally larger unit counts in comparison to vanilla sometimes overwhelm the AI</li>
<li>Non-Kapaku AIs will no longer research volcanic techs without possessing volcanic regions</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Modding</em></p>
<ul>
<li>New Debug-Command: "/Teleport" teleports the selected army to a world coordinate of the players choice</li>
<li>Army Debugger is now displayed correctly for colossi</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changelog for v2.2.0:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ports the Community patch to Endless Legend v1.6.10 S3</li>
<li>The official patch solves the Cultis Village upkeep bug, therefor my workaround is no longer needed</li>
</ul>
<p><em>General</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a new advanced pre-game setting: "Army Speed Scale Factor" (by morgoth)
<ul>
<li>Sets the default speed of Armies on the world map</li>
<li>Default Value is "Classic" (same speed as Vanilla)</li>
<li>Can also be changed ingame with the new /SetArmySpeed console commando (Single Player only)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed the "Coastal Cultists" mod and replaced it with a new custom spawn logic
<ul>
<li>While immediate ocean access is important for Cultists (as they cant get it later in the game for obvious reasons) there have been complaints, that cultist spawns near water sometimes leave the player little options to explore alternative spots if the spawn is bad</li>
<li>A new revamped spawn logic ensures that the region a Cultist player starts in a region that has ocean access, while simultaneously preferring more central spawn locations in the region itself</li>
<li>This should give the player more options to explore an alternative colonization location if necessary</li>
<li>Also heavily reduced the chance for cultists to spawn in volcanic regions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While at it, also ensured the Morgawr spawn in a region with ocean access</li>
<li>When starting a new game with "Faction Randomization" set to "Unique", the game will now treat Vaulters and Mezari as the same faction, so only one of both may spawn
<ul>
<li>Custom factions based on Vaulters or Mezari are exempt from this rule</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>UI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Players can now modify the Zoom Level at which the World View transitions from the detailed 3D View to the less detailed abstract View (programmed by morgoth)
<ul>
<li>The new slider has been added to the UI-Options menu</li>
<li>Note: High values can lead to decreased performance when zooming out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changed the sorting of heros in the Academy Screen in order to make finding heroes that need orders or a level up easier
<ul>
<li>Heros that have skill points left or need an assignment are now sorted to the front</li>
<li>Accordingly, when opening the Academy Screen the default position is now at the start of the hero list</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Balance [XML]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The resource bonus gained by controlling an oceanic region now scales with the Era the Player is in (starting with 0 at Era 1 up to the old value 0.5 at Era 6) (thanks Cornebre)
<ul>
<li>The resource amount gained from oceans always felt disproportionate in the early game, especially since two of the stronger factions (morgawr and allayi) have immediate access to it</li>
<li>The change should lessen the early game dominance of oceans while leaving their late game value intact</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Halved the effect of Centre of Influence and Dust accumulator</li>
<li>Increased base Initiative of Dust Bishops (Broken lords support Unit) by 10 in order to make usage of their healing passive more reliable</li>
</ul>
<p><em>AI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>AIs will now actively solve the Winter Most Worrying competitive quest</li>
<li>Updated the Unit Design weights (by CeltiK)</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that led to AI Colossi rarely being equipped with accessories</li>
<li>When creating or altering unit designs, the AI will now try to avoid choosing accessory items with capacities the Unit already has</li>
<li>Fixed a bug introduced by an older version of ELCP that led to pre era 4 empires sometimes preferring their units to be naked instead of equipping iron - whoops! (thanks CeltiK)</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that led to the AI being overaggressive with weak armies</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused Armies with only a hero in it to be jobless due to the AI perceiving it as a Naval Army (thanks Cornebre)</li>
<li>AIs are better at chosing save settling locations during wartimes</li>
<li>Necrophages army commanders are no longer confused by large army sizes (&gt;8), which led to them doing nothing previously</li>
<li>Fixed conflux collection logic, AIs value them correctly now and will no longer try to collect already collected ones</li>
<li>Army Commanders will no longer skip whole turns if the target they want to reach is unreachable due to an ongoing battle</li>
<li>AIs no longer try to use Soul Burn as non-Broken Lord, getting stuck during eclipses</li>
<li>AIs can now buy stockpiles from the market</li>
<li>AIs will now prefer assigning kapaku governors to cities with volcanic terrain</li>
<li>Fixed the nonfunctional diplomatic response function to war declarations, AI are now able to consider strategic Alliances during war times</li>
<li>AIs will now value war declarations on enemies they are in war with higher (exposed a new variable "AtWarWith" for modders to use)
<ul>
<li>They are also less eager to play wardog for the player, except when the player offers to join the war aswell</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allied AIs will take note, if you dont answer help requests during wars</li>
<li>AIs now have a minimum value they assign to resources, in order to prevent them from being too generous when they are rich</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changelog for v2.1.7:</h3>
<p><em>General</em></p>
<ul>
<li>ELCP specific settings now have their own category in the "Advanced Game Settings" pre-game menu
<ul>
<li>The "Miscellaneous"-category got a bit crowded, and there will likely be more settings to come in future versions</li>
<li>Depending on your resolution and whether you have the Big Screen UI activated, settings may look a bit "squeezed together". This was necessary so I could fit them all on the screen.</li>
<li>Small Issue: Due to a hard to fix bug the settings screen may be misaligned when opening it right after changing the resolution or toggling the Big Screen UI. Just close and reopen the screen in that case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed Sacrifice Population (Necrophages) not scaling with game speed (thanks Cornebre)
<ul>
<li>Pops are worth more turns the slower the game speed, making this tech almost useless on every game speed except fast, which is why I consider this a bug</li>
<li>The old value (one turn per pop) is now the base value for fast game speed</li>
<li>Slower game-speeds scale accordingly, that means: 2 turns per pop on normal, 3 turns per pop on slow, 4 turns per pop on endless</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Included a workaround for the cultist village bug
<ul>
<li>The bug causes converted villages to be counted twice towards upkeep and empire plan cost</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Balance [Core files]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Units can no longer be sold when in foreign territory
<ul>
<li>Note: Fortresses and (converted) Villages count as owned territory, units can still be sold there</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changed the way Stockpile Upgrading works, you will now lose half of your stockpiles when upgrading them to the next level (decimals are rounded up in the players favor)
<ul>
<li>Reasoning: While stockpiles themselves are fine, the upgrade mechanic is ridiculously strong to the point that its disallowed in many multiplayer games</li>
<li>So the challenge was to make upgrading them weaker (but still viable!) while keeping the raw numbers the same (in order to avoid nerfing cultists too much)</li>
<li>example: 10 level 0 Industry Stockpiles (10 x +100 Industry) will be upgraded to 5 level 1 Industry Stockpiles (5 x +600 Industry) after researching "Unskilled Labor"</li>
<li>5 level 1 Industry Stockpiles (5 x +600 Industry) will be upgraded to 3 level 3 Industry Stockpiles (3 x +1600 Industry) after researching "Organized Labor"</li>
<li>10 level 0 Industry Stockpiles (10 x +100 Industry) will be upgraded to 3 level 2 Industry Stockpiles (3 x +1100 Industry) after researching "Organized Labor" without researching "Unskilled Labor" first</li>
<li>can be deactivated in the "Advanced Game Settings" pre-game menu</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Balance [XML]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced Construction Costs for Stockpiles across the board (to make actually constructing them more attractive)
<ul>
<li>Level 1 from 1200 to 900, Level 2/3 from 2500 to 2000</li>
<li>Level 1 Pearl from 600 to 450, Level 2 Pearl from 1100 to 850, Level 3 Pearl from 1600 to 1200</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reverted the old buff to the wood based summer industry bonus of Living Towns (Wild Walkers)
<ul>
<li>This buff was a compensation for some nerfs they received, since those nerfs are no loner in place and building cost reduction stacking was solved differently, the buff is no longer needed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Feedback from reddit users and experienced players indicate, that the broken lords currently struggle a bit compared to most of the other factions, the following changes have been made:
<ul>
<li>Quest 1.1 now requires 2 infantry escorts instead of 3 (can be done immediatly)</li>
<li>Quest 2 now requires 6/10 Era 1 techs instead of 8/12</li>
<li>These quests were very annoying to solve, since they require you to do stuff early that actively harms your progress. Additionally delaying them for too long may make the next quest (settlement with 13 dust min) very hard to do.</li>
<li>Also reduced the cost of Population Buyout by 10% across the board</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Increased number of heroes in the market by about 2 (1 exclusive, 1 general)</li>
<li>Reduced Neros' base stats significantly (Damage down by 70%, Health down by 18%, Attack down by 20%) and reduced damage of Vortex of the Polar Ice by 40%
<ul>
<li>This Guardian typically just one-shotted armies on its own, the changes should tone it down to a more manageable level</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Activating already active luxury boosters resets the duration instead of adding it on top of the current duration
<ul>
<li>Stacking luxury booster duration made the 130 resource reward (Wine!) gained from the era 1 deed way too powerful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added cooldowns to some diplomatic abilities
<ul>
<li>Market ban can not be used for 2 turns after a ban was removed (in order to give chain banned empires a chance to buy at least some heroes)</li>
<li>Force Truce can not be used for 5 turns after a Drakken has declared war on someone (to give roving clans a chance to recapture cities lost in surprise attacks)</li>
<li>Note: Force Truce cooldown only applies if the Drakken Player started the war</li>
<li>Cooldowns are seperate for each diplomatic contact - If Empire A removes your market ban, you can still ban Empire B without having to wait</li>
<li>The new DiplomaticCooldownPrerequisite can be freely used by modders</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>AI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Units will now specifically try to move away from reinforcement positions to make space for new reinforcements (programmed by morgoth)
<ul>
<li>Often times, ranged units kept blocking the reinforcement spot if they were content with their position and could reach their intended target (AI had trouble handling this)</li>
<li>Now they will move away - will also affect human controlled units!</li>
<li>If you want them to stay on that position for some reason, use the "hold position" stance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AIs will now search Temples during Dust Eclipse</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused AI empires with shipyard tech being unable to search ruins on land</li>
<li>Fixed a rare bug, where an AI empire would go crazy and spam settlers without any regions to colonize (at least I hope so)</li>
<li>AIs can now solve the "Accursed Bounty" competitive quest</li>
<li>Vaulters/Mezari can now use their teleport ability, defensive only for now (thanks morgoth)</li>
<li>Roving clans make use of privateers when they are rich enough</li>
<li>Drakken are more likely to use their "Force Status" diplomatic abilities</li>
<li>AIs will now use their patrol units to defend besieged cities</li>
<li>Discouraged AIs from spamming some of the weaker units too much (Preachers, Masterminds, Ceratans, Driders)</li>
<li>Opened up my old "greedy" Cultist production AI for other Empires
<ul>
<li>they should favor developing their cities more rather than spamming units</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Increased AIs willingness to retrofit units when at war</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changelog for v2.1.5:</h3>
<p><em>General</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Reintroduced my old Advanced World Setting "Replace Inland Seas", since AIs building ships in small ponds was NOT fixed in every case by the latest official patches -by default it is activated, which means ocean tiles without access to fortresses get transformed into inland water tiles on map generation (to prevent ships being build on them) -the feature can be deactivated in the world generation settings -if no fortresses are present, no tiles will be replaced</li>
<li>Fixed Fortification HP not being correctly applied to reinforcements in spectator battles -The first turn of a spectator battle may take a while as a result of my "fix" (I'll try to find a better solution if enough people care about spectator battles)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a City's Fortification would be reduces to zero if a contender retreated</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a unit not being able to join a battle would count a unit that lost all of its Armor when calculating the after-battle Fortification loss</li>
<li>Players can now only dismantle buildings if they have full ownership over a (recently conquered) city</li>
</ul>
<p><em>UI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Assimilation effects are now displayed in the tooltip of Villages as well
<ul>
<li>This should help new players, who have not yet memorized all the assimilation effects</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Right- or Middle-Clicking a unit icon in an army list panel now also opens the Unit Designer</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Balance [Core files]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Introduced a new optional rule-set for Fortification Armor and when it applies
<ul>
<li>When creating a lobby, a new game play option is available: "Fortification Rules"</li>
<li>Players can choose between "Classic" (the old rule-set) or "ELCP" (the new default)</li>
<li>Under the old rule-set, Fortification Bonus only got applied, if a city is directly attacked. The defending army and all reinforcements got the Bonus.</li>
<li>Under the "ELCP" rule-set, Fortification gets applied as soon as at least one of the two main contenders is on a City Tile or an Exploitation Tile - it doesnt matter who attacked!</li>
<li>But: Only Armies that are located on a City Tile (District) get the Fortification Bonus! Reinforcements that are not on a City Tile dont get the Bonus!</li>
<li>Reinforcements for City Defenses are therefore weakened, but in turn offensive use of Fortification is now possible!</li>
<li>All in all this should make defensive play a stronger option. Under classic rules, heaving lots of Fortification only delayed the inevitable when being besieged.</li>
<li>Under the "ELCP" rule set, defenders with an inferior army can attack out of their city and turn the tides with that hefty Armor Bonus!</li>
<li>Attackers on the other hand may decide that 400 fortification cultist city is too dangerous, some pillaging will have to do.</li>
<li>See [<a href="https://imgur.com/a/5fAh681">here</a>] for a graphic explanation!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed the ability to conquer cities and fortresses (whose region are owned by the target) of blackspot victims without declaring war
<ul>
<li>The morgawr are one of the more powerful factions anyway, and especially roving clans players where essentially powerless against this action</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Balance [XML]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Introduced multiplicative stacking for Production Cost Reduction and Buyout Cost Reduction (Buildings and Units)
<ul>
<li>An example: Empire Plan Science and Industry Level 2 (33%), Behemoth Tamer Level 2 (Wild Walker Governore Skill) 2*12%, 2 assimilated Urces Villaged (10%)</li>
<li>Under the old additive stacking rules, this would result in 33% + 2*12% + 10% = 67% reduction, Buildings only cost 33% of their original value</li>
<li>Under the new multiplicative stacking rules, this results in 1-((1-0.33)<em>(1-0.12)</em>(1-0.12)*(1-0.10)) = 53% reduction, Buildings cost 47% of their original value</li>
<li>This means that Stacking these bonuses is less effective the more you do it, and - first and foremost - reaching 100% reduction is no longer possible</li>
<li>This change was implemented to combat the strength of stacking construction cost reduction and buyout cost reduction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reverted the old nerfs to the Wild Walker governor Skill "Behemoth Tamer" and the "Growing Buildings" quest tech
<ul>
<li>With the new multiplicative stacking these nerfs are no longer necessary</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduced the Cost of the "Endless Temple" Victory wonder from 90000 to 72000 (still nerfed compared to Vanilla, but less so)</li>
<li>Reduced the needed amount of a random luxury resource for the second stage of the necrophage faction quest from 20 to 5 and the dust amount from 150 to 100
<ul>
<li>Necrophages are on the weaker side of the faction spectrum, while their units are strong, their growth and production is slow at the start, and they are dependent on getting some good early fights for boosters and later battleborn</li>
<li>I have found in my games that the time it takes to get that second quest done for the free hero often dictates how succesfull the rest of the game is</li>
<li>Making the quest easier (and more reliable) to achieve should give necros a boost in reliability when it comes to their early game</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>AI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved Unit Designer logic for heroes
<ul>
<li>AI now ignores the Item Cost of the current design, when comparing with a hypothetical new design (since the cost has already been paid)</li>
<li>AIs will heavily favor Iron Talisman on Generals that slow their army down</li>
<li>Heros will now heavily favor Items that fit their current role (Governors will mostly ignore Army Items, Spies heavily favor scopes etc.)</li>
<li>AIs now take their strategic resource stock into account, when deciding on unit designs, not just their income</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AIs are now forced to research shipyard if they can no longer expand and there are multiple continents in the game</li>
<li>AIs are now forced to buy heroes if they sit on money and could use them</li>
<li>Camps are garrisoned more sensible
<ul>
<li>The AI was very eager to fully man all its Camps, even the ones that were secure in its heartland</li>
<li>The AI now takes into account, how secure a position is so it doesnt waste so many units</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>fixed an issue where very weak starting units (cultists, morgawr) would sometimes do nothing because they were too scared of exploring</li>
<li>AIs are less likely to join battles when defending empty Villages or Camps</li>
<li>As always many smaller .xml related improvements, among them:
<ul>
<li>cultists will no longer think "Right of way" helps them connecting their villages with roads</li>
<li>Kapaku now get a strong boost to their willingness to research Camps and their special Stockpiles (when at war)</li>
<li>Forgotten are more likely to research "What's Mine is Mine" if they have active spies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>made slight improvements to the offensive battle behavior of ranged units and driders (thanks morgoth!)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Modding</em></p>
<ul>
<li>CanFreeEmbark now checks for "FactionTraitSeaDemons1" instead of "AffinitySeaDemons" in order to allow modders to use it for other factions</li>
<li>Autoturn no longer stops on its own when assertions fail or error logs occur, making this command more useful for afk-AI testing (thanks morgoth!)</li>
<li>The god cursor "Spawn allied Army" cheat now spawns an army of the currently selected empire instead of always the first one</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changelog for v2.1.31:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hotfix for a bug in 2.1.3 that led to the AI locking up and massive logspam ... sorry :(</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changelog for v2.1.3:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ports the Community patch to Endless Legend v1.6.4 S3</li>
<li>Patch 1.6.4 partially solves the following issues:
<ul>
<li>stealth fixed a bug with coastal tile evaluation for colonization (but not expansion!)</li>
<li>attempted to fix AIs colonization logic, change doesnt go far enough, so I keep my code in</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since I know that not everyone is a fan of my balance changes, I uploaded a mod, that reverses all the .xml changes I made!,&nbsp;<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1473002612">Follow this Link!</a>
<ul>
<li>I will keep this mod up to date with every new release. So as long as you stay subscribed, you stay vanilla!</li>
<li>Note: Hardcoded changes that I provide an ingame option for (like the progressive techtrade cost) are not affected by the mod, you'll need to deactivate them once in the pregame lobby.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Changes in ELCP v2.1.3:

<p><em>UI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Selecting the Icon of a known living Empire on the End-Turn-Panel with the right or middle mouse button now opens the diplomatic Negotiation Screen with that Empire</li>
<li>Capacity list icons are now colored depending on the Capacity Provider
<ul>
<li>This should make it easier to see at a glance, what hero and/or item specific abilities a hero or unit possesses</li>
<li>Categories are: (1) Capacities provided by the unit design or the hero class + faction, (2) Capacities that are unique to that hero, (3) Capacities that are provided by items</li>
<li>Colors can be customized in the game's UI-Options menu</li>
<li>I also improved the sorting algorithm so the icons no longer shuffle around wildly, each team you change the equipment of the hero/unit design</li>
<li>Icons are now sorted after category (1>2>3) and alphabetically</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Balance</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Increased the market value of Stockpiles (for buying and selling!)
<ul>
<li>Stockpiles in general are too cheap for their use. No one in their right mind sells 1600 industry for a bit over 100 gold.</li>
<li>This also weakens early stockpile rushes a bit (but not by much, pearl stockpiles are unchanged for now)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reduced Damage and HP bonus of Serum of Iteru by 50%
<ul>
<li>This tech basically meant "game over", I think toning it down to "still very strong" is waranted</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Increased the wood based summer industry bonus of Living Towns (Wild Walkers) from 1 to 2
<ul>
<li>Wild Walkers got hit by a number of indirect and direct nerfs in my attempts to balance the Wonder Victory</li>
<li>Since they don't have that much going for them besides this, I think buffing their early game potential makes them a bit more competitive with other explosive factions</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>AI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements to the AIs tech and Wonder priorities inspired by community member CeltiK</li>
<li>Further improvements to AIs booster usage, Production utilization, Unit Designs and Encounter logic</li>
<li>AIs will now consider selling Stockpiles to the Market in times of need</li>
<li>Golem Camp placement is no longer completely random</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where AIs did not know how to use Industry boosters gained from the "Siege Engineering" tech</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changelog for v2.1.2:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ports the Community patch to Endless Legend v1.6.2 S3 (Inferno)</li>
<li>Inferno patch solves the following issues:
<ul>
<li>AIs building ships in "ponds", therefore I removed the Setting "Replace Inland seas" since it should no longer be necessary</li>
<li>Idle army button</li>
<li>Cultists aquiring more than one city</li>
<li>Forgotten Techtrade bug</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Everything else was not or only partially resolved by Inferno, so most of my old stuff stays in</li></ul>
There is also some new stuff:

<p><em>UI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Selecting a Unit Design in a Cities construction menu with the right or middle mouse button now opens the Unit Designer</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Balance</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Increased HP reduction from retreating to 60% (up from 50%)
<ul>
<li>this means without some regeneration, you can only retreat savely once, reducing the power of stalling somewhat</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>AI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved AI engagement logic
<ul>
<li>fixed an issue that lead to the AI thinking Fortification-HP also applies when it attacks out of its besieged City</li>
<li>AIs can now assign more than one army to defend a besieged city</li>
<li>When defending a besieged city, the AI tries to initiate the fight with its strongest army present</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that lead to the AI not bringing reinforcements when defending a city</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implemented an experimental quest solving logic for the "From Dust to Rust" quest
<ul>
<li>AIs can now do this cooperative quests on their own and without cheating</li>
<li>this should resolve annoying situations where the player is unable to reach any of the three quest ruins in order to get rid of the negative effect</li>
<li>logic for other quests may follow in future updates</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improvements to the region evaluation for war, AIs are less likely to skip regions when attacking cities</li>
<li>AIs are more likely to send stronger invading armies (or several of them)</li>
<li>Small empires get an additional boost to their willingness to settle, depending on the game turn</li>
<li>Fixed a bug were AIs of higher difficulty were less annoyed when being terraformed instead of more (Inferno)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changelog for v2.1.0:</h3>
<p><em>General</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where hovering over the "End Turn"-Button would reveal the total score of other empires, even when score display was set to "partial" or "none"</li>
<li>Hosts can now setup Handicaps for individual players, increasing or decreasing their FIDSI income in cities
<ul>
<li>This is intended to level the playing field in multiplayer games where people of vastly different skill levels may play together</li>
<li>As soon as at least one player has a positive Handicap (i.e. gets bonus FIDSI), achievements are disabled</li>
<li>The host can not modify the Handicap of players that changed their state to "ready" (to prevent "last second ninja handicap" trolling)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Balance</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Introduced a new optional feature: progressive tech trade costs
<ul>
<li>when creating a lobby, a new game play option is available: "Tech Trade Cost Progression"</li>
<li>it offers the settings light, moderate (the new default), harsh and classic (this deactivates the feature and reverts everything to its old state)</li>
<li>On moderate (normal speed), each past technology trade an empire was involved in raises the Influence cost of future tech trades by 2 Influence points</li>
<li>this cost increase is tripled for each tech an empire traded with the current trading partner (to encourage "spreading the love" for avid tech traders)</li>
<li>the progressive cost is not reduced by any effects (like infiltration actions or the allayi passive) and is only influenced by the game speed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduced Diplomatic Points gained via diplomatic treaties from 0.2 to 0.1 per influence point spent
<ul>
<li>This should make "explosive" diplomatic victories harder (players bunker a bunch of Influence and then cruise to victory without others being able to react in a matter of few turns)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Increased passive Diplomatic Point gain from alliances from 4 to 5
<ul>
<li>this should encourage building Alliances for Diplo Victory hunters a bit more (instead of only spamming mass treaties)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Increased the dust requirement for an Economic Victory by 20%</li>
<li>Increased the cost of the "Endless Temple" Victory wonder by 150%
<ul>
<li>Any lategame city (especially in combination with building cost reduction and Boosters) could complete this wonder in a Matter of 5 - 10 turns, Wild Walkers even in 1 or 2</li>
<li>this change was made to bring it more in line with the Quest Victory it directly competes with</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduced Building Production Cost Reduction of "Growing Buildings" (Wild Walker quest tech) from 25% to 15%</li>
<li>Reduced Building Production Cost Reduction of "Behemoth Tamer" (Wild Walker Governor skill) from 12% to 10% per level</li>
</ul>
<p><em>AI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved the diplomatic AI significantly
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that would prevent AIs from making "third party requests" (like asking other empires to declare war on someone)</li>
<li>When interacting amongst each other, AIs will now avoid proposing deals that the other party wont accept (will lead to more successfull deals amongst AI empires)</li>
<li>AIs no longer overvalue the player offering war declarations on weak enemies (thanks Cornebre!)</li>
<li>Many improvements to the Influence Accounting that should result in AIs pursuing more diplomatic interactions</li>
<li>AIs will evaluate stockpiles better when trading (will take into account how many they have, how much they need them, if they have the techs)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AIs are now better at keeping their production queues busy (thanks Cornebre!)
<ul>
<li>they often had empty production queues in their cities or wasted large proportions of their industry stockpiles</li>
<li>New "last resort" production logic overrrides the normal production AI if it detects cities not being used properly</li>
<li>this may lead to a AI turns being a bit longer in the late game (but typically the player has a lot to do then anyway)</li>
<li>AIs now immediatly queue up buildings on newly settled cities (thanks Cornebre!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AIs will no longer waste Industry Stockpiles to produce further Stockpiles (thanks Cornebre!)</li>
<li>Having Stockpiles will make the AI more likely to research Stockpile techs</li>
<li>AIs will now switch to cheaper unit designs faster if they cant afford the current one</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where AIs with low number of cities (cultists...) would sometimes refuse to use food stockpiles</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where AIs would undervalue dust equipment heavily even when they have lots of dust (to the point of them prefering iron sometimes)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the Account Manager that lead to the Morgawr AI not using its "Dissent" ability</li>
<li>many minor bugfixes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changelog for v2.0.4:</h3>
<p><em>General</em></p>
<ul>
<li>resource stock and income values between 1000 and 10000 are now truncated to one decimal place (Implemented by fellow modder Cornebre)
<ul>
<li>previously it would only display values like "2k", now it displays more precise information like "2.6k"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>included the Coastal Cultist mod by sudocrem (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=972760821">Link</a>)
<ul>
<li>Cultists have a higher Chance to spawn near an Ocean, similar to the Morgawr</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>fixed an annoying issue where moving away a single army from a besieged city would end the siege, even if other armies are still next to the target city</li>
<li>fixed a bug that led to endless sieges
<ul>
<li>it happened when a single besieging army would embark to a watertile that is still next to the besieged city. The army could then leave and the siege would continue indefinitly until broken otherwise</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>AI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved the Cultist AI significantly,&nbsp;<a href="https://imgur.com/a/xreV4rZ">Deus Cult!</a>
<ul>
<li>heavily increased the value the AI places on converting villages</li>
<li>previously they mostly ignored the free armies from converted villages since they had no routine to manage them, now they will use them or sell them</li>
<li>they now take potential resources gained from villages into account, when deciding whether to research resource extractors (previously they ignored them if the resource wasnt in their home region)</li>
<li>boosted their willingness to develop their city over spamming units</li>
<li>they treat their City being besieged a bit more seriously</li>
<li>they will now consider "colonizing" (i.e. converting villages on) islands and other continents</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the AI can now parley with villages and accept their quests
<ul>
<li>this should mainly help AIs with weak starting units (cultists...) since others usually just fight them</li>
<li>also fixed a bug that prevented villages from being pacified if a pacification quest was solved by the AI</li>
<li>Note: the AI still doesnt actively solve objectives but uses a chance based auto questsolver</li>
<li>"Real" quest solving AI for some quests (victory?) may follow in the future ...maybe ... if I'm insane enough</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the AI will no longer research pearl hoarding, except when they got other booster techs and have a huge pile of pearls</li>
<li>the AI will now release some garrison units when it cant finish unit production due to full garrison</li>
<li>many smaller .xml related fixes (thanks Cornebre!)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Modding Tools</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The god cursor ("G") now shows the current world position</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changelog for v2.0.3:</h3>
<p><em>General</em></p>
<ul>
<li>fixed "Luxury Alchemists" increasing the duration of&nbsp;<em>everything</em>&nbsp;that used BoosterDurationMultiplier
<ul>
<li>previously stockpile boosters and even infiltration actions like "decrease fortification" and "poison governor" were affected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the effect of "Luxury Alchemists" now kicks in after the first booster is activated to match its description
<ul>
<li>previously it would only activate after at least 2 boosters were active</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>AI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>tackled a bunch of spy related issues
<ul>
<li>fixed an issue with AIs really wanting to infiltrate cities they dont have vision on (led to unemployed spies)</li>
<li>fixed an issue where the AI really wants to spy on a city that already has a spy of the same empire in it (led to unemployed spies)</li>
<li>lessened the AIs desire to shuffle spies around (so they can gain seniority)</li>
<li>fixed an internal issues which lead to AIs overvaluing spies in general</li>
<li>fixed a NullReferenceException that could lead to spies doing nothing during war</li>
<li>fixed an issue where war with an infiltrated empire would lower the chance of hurtful actions (like decrease population) instead of increasing it</li>
<li>improved technology steal routine (Forgotten shouldnt fall so far behind technologically now)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>exposed a new .xml element "IdealBuyoutPeriod" that governs the Forgotten AI's willingness to buy tech, put in values that should make Forgotten AI more competitive on higher difficulties
<ul>
<li>The old TechnologyBuyoutReferenceRatioAgent seems to quite literally do nothing which lead to forgotten AI falling behind on higher difficulties (maybe a leftover from early development?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The AI didnt know it could restore injured heroes for dust, thanks to a new routine it does now</li>
<li>AIs now try to avoid assigning governors to cities that are under siege (led to unemployed governors)</li>
<li>minor bugfixes in the .xml files</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changelog for v2.0.2:</h3>
<p><em>General</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the idle army button sometimes not working correctly as the game progresses</li>
<li>Cultists can no longer obtain multiple cities via trade.
<ul>
<li>Cities aquired via trade are immediatly razed, stockpiles are gained according to tech.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>new cheat commando: ShowMeTheStockpiles (player gets the specified amount of each stockpile, 10 by default)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>AI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>AI now wants to build more units on higher difficulties (they often had many idle cities)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAYL5H46QnQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=18">Did this</a>&nbsp;with large parts of the overly complicated and buggy colonization routines, replaced it with a simpler and more robust calculation
<ul>
<li>AIs should now choose better locations, no more "settling next to a rock"</li>
<li>If you notice weird behavior, message me!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AI now assign a very low utility value to fortresses they get from trades, except when it helps them to control the respective ocean region
<ul>
<li>this is to prevent a fortress trade exploit (give the AI fortresses it cant defend for tech/resources, then immediatly reclaim them without triggering a war)</li>
<li>utility values may receive further balancing in future patches, depending on feedback</li>
<li>exposed a new value for modders in the corresponding xml file: $(RegionCompletion)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slightly improved AI stockpile usage
<ul>
<li>Science stockpiles now will be used one at a time instead of all at once</li>
<li>AIs that got stockpiles early on (Cultists, Necrophages) will refrain from using them if they are close to a tech upgrade (like "Unskilled Labor")</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changelog for v2.0.1:</h3>
<p><em>General</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><em>AI</em></p>
<ul>
<li>AI Spies have a higher probability to "do nothing" and wait until their infiltration level raises higher (especially when they can steal tech)</li>
<li>Exposed a new personality specific xml element for modders: "BoostThresholdForBetterTechsteal"</li>
<li>Made AI a bit more likely to seek alliances when having a common foe</li>
<li>Included the mod "Improved AI" by ninakoru (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=851891695">link</a>)</li>
<li>Included the mod "Forgotten Techtrade Workaround" by me (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1374834297">link</a>), proper fix may follow in the future</li>
</ul>
<p><em>World Generator</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a new Advanced World Setting "Replace Inland Seas"; activating this transforms Oceans without fortress access to lakes.</li>
<li>This is a workaround to prevent the AI from building fleets into useless puddles</li>
